    "title": "Jennifer Crumbley, mother of Ethan Crumbley, found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in son\u2019s school shooting",
    "text": "PONTIAC, Mich. \u2014 Jennifer Crumbley, the Michigan woman charged in connection with her son\u2019s deadly school shooting rampage in 2021, was convicted Tuesday of involuntary manslaughter in the unprecedented case.\n\nThe unanimous verdict came on the second day of jury deliberations in a landmark trial in which Crumbley became the first parent to be held criminally responsible for a mass shooting committed by their child.\n\nCrumbley, 45, was charged with four counts of involuntary manslaughter \u2014 one for each of the victims in the attack at Oxford High School in November 2021. Her son, Ethan, now 17, pleaded guilty as an adult to murder, terrorism and other crimes, and was sentenced in December to life in prison without parole.\n\nNow, she faces up to 15 years in prison per count and remains held on bond. She will be sentenced on April 9.\n\nThe father of Justin Shilling, 17, one of the four victims in the school shooting, teared up when the verdict was announced. He later hugged Oakland County prosecutor Karen McDonald and members of her team and shook the hands of law enforcement officers who testified.\n\n\"We have been asking for accountability across the board, and this is one step towards that,\" Craig Shilling said outside of the courtroom. \"I feel that moving forward is not going to be any easier because of what we left behind, but it gives us hope for a brighter future.\"\n\nThe trial, which opened Jan. 25 in an Oakland County courtroom, hit at themes of good parenting and gun safety, and has come at a consequential moment in the U.S. when a drumbeat of school shootings have roiled communities like Uvalde, Texas; Nashville; and Perry, Iowa.\n\nIn an effort to determine to what extent a parent should be held accountable for the actions of their child, jurors in Oakland County examined more than 400 pieces of evidence, including text messages and photos from Crumbley's cellphone, and dramatic video of the shooting spree, which left many in the courtroom visibly shaken.\n\nThe prosecution called more than 20 witnesses, including law enforcement and school staff, while the defense brought in just one: the defendant.\n\nTo prove its case, the prosecution attempted to portray Crumbley as a neglectful mother, who cared more about her hobbies and carrying on an extramarital affair than spending time with her son. Then, when she and her husband gifted their son a semi-automatic handgun in the days before the shooting, prosecutors pointed out that neither of them properly stored it.\n\nOn the same day as the shooting, when the Crumbleys were earlier summoned to the school because of a disturbing drawing of a gun made by their son, the parents didn't tell school officials he had access to a weapon or take him home.\n\nEthan would go on to kill four students: Shilling; Madisyn Baldwin, 17; Tate Myre, 16; and Hana St. Juliana, 14.\n\nBut Crumbley's defense lawyer, Shannon Smith, suggested it was James Crumbley who was specifically in charge of storing the weapon, and that the school knew Ethan was having trouble paying attention in classes but didn't fully inform Jennifer Crumbley.\n\nSmith had asked the jury during her closing argument to acquit her client, \"not just for Jennifer Crumbley, but for every mother who's out there doing the best they can, who could easily be in her shoes.\"\n\nJames Crumbley, 47, is expected to stand trial next month on the same involuntary manslaughter charges.\n\nThe judge in Crumbley's trial imposed a gag order that prevents the prosecution and defense from speaking publicly until after James Crumbley's trial.\n\nJennifer Crumbley took the stand in her own defense. She testified that her son was generally worried about his future after high school and was \"depressed,\" but that his mental health never alarmed her enough that she felt he needed to see a professional.\n\nShe acknowledged that she could have taken him home on the day of the shooting, but also didn't believe he was capable of committing such violence. More than two years after the shooting, she told the jury she \"wouldn't have\" done anything differently.\n\n\"I don't think I\u2019m a failure as a parent,\" she said.\n\nCraig Shilling said the jury's decision shows how important it is for parents to be mindful of their children's needs.\n\n\"Do your due diligence with your child,\" he said. \"You cannot choose to take your own interest over your child, especially when it comes to mental health.\"\n\nGun safety groups echoed that the verdict is a warning that parents can be held responsible.\n\n\"Plain and simple, the deadly shooting at Oxford High School in 2021 should have \u2014 and could have \u2014 been prevented had the Crumbley's not acquired a gun for their 15-year-old son,\" Nick Suplina, senior vice president for law and policy at Everytown for Gun Safety, said in a statement. \"This decision is an important step forward in ensuring accountability and, hopefully, preventing future tragedies.\"\n\nSelina Guevara reported from Pontiac and Erik Ortiz from New York.",

    "text": "In a speech accepting the Dr. Dre Global Impact Award at the Grammy Awards, rapper Jay Z seemingly called out the Recording Academy.\n\nAs his daughter, Blue Ivy, 12, stood by his side, Jay-Z noted that while music and therefore voting on the Grammy Awards is \u201cobviously subjective,\u201d his wife, Beyonc\u00e9 has never won in the album of the year category.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to embarrass this young lady, but she has more Grammys than everyone, and never won album of the year,\u201d he said, seemingly referring to his wife. \u201cSo even by your own metrics, that doesn\u2019t work. Think about that. The most Grammys, never won album of the year. That doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nHe went on to double down, adding: \u201cSome of you are gonna go home tonight and feel like you\u2019ve been robbed. Some of you may get robbed. Some of you don\u2019t belong in the category,\u201d before clarifying: \u201cWhen I get nervous, I tell the truth.\u201d\n\nJay-Z, tied with Ye (formerly known as Kanye West), has the distinction of rapper with the most Grammy wins in history.

    "title": "A Chicago Latino was exonerated after spending 25 years in prison for murder",
    "text": "After having spent 25 years in prison for murder, Jos\u00e9 Tinajero is now a free man. His conviction and that of Thomas Kelly, another man who was accused of the same crime, were overturned last week by a Chicago judge.\n\n\u201cBeing free is a real challenge for me. My mom took me to a TJ Maxx store to shop, and I felt like everyone was looking at me. It was very uncomfortable. I felt like I was out of place. It\u2019s hard to deal with this,\u201d Tinajero, 45, said in an exclusive interview with Noticias Telemundo on Friday.\n\n\u201cI just want to spend time with my family, you know? They were always there for me. My mom, my daughter and now I have a granddaughter,\u201d he said. \u201cI have to make up for lost time with my daughter, because I was out of her life for 25 whole years and I have to make peace with her. My future is to focus on my family, and work, of course, to help support them.\u201d\n\nJos\u00e9 Tinajero, 45, during an interview with Noticias Telemundo from his home in Chicago on Friday. Albinson Linares\n\nAlthough Tinajero\u2019s conviction was overturned Wednesday, he remained incarcerated at the Kewanee Correctional Facility, about 150 miles southwest of Chicago, until Thursday afternoon, when he was able to return home and reunite with his loved ones.\n\n\u201cI was born here in Chicago, in the United States, and I was raised by a great mother who did everything she could for me. My father left us when I was very young, but my mother did a great job, and she has suffered a lot from all of this,\u201d he said.\n\nIn 1999, Tinajero and Kelly were arrested in the murder of Daniel Garcia, who was beaten on Oct. 12, 1998, in an alley near Whipple and Armitage streets. Kelly and Tinajero, along with John Martinez, whose case was dismissed nearly a year ago, allege they were coerced into making false confessions by Reynaldo Guevara, who at the time was a Chicago police detective.\n\nGuevara is accused of falsely incriminating dozens of men and women from the 1980s to the early 2000s. So far, 40 people have been exonerated in cases related to Guevara, who, in his court appearances, has repeatedly invoked the Fifth Amendment in relation to any allegations against him. He has never been charged.\n\nAccording to an investigation WGN-TV published in October, Guevara, who retired in 2005, has been living in Texas.\n\nLast year, an investigation by NBC Chicago concluded that the settlements for all the wrongful convictions the city of Chicago has paid since 2010 total more than $288 million, including cases related to Guevara.\n\nIn August 2022, Cook County State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx announced an investigation into Guevara\u2019s convictions from the 1980s and the 1990s, saying: \u201cWe can no longer uphold these convictions. We cannot retry these cases based on the evidence we have today.\u201d\n\nThere are still about 32 lawsuits pending in court that have been filed by exonerated people who have accused Guevara of having fixed their murder cases through witness tampering, coerced confessions and more.\n\nJoel Flaxman, Tinajero\u2019s lawyer, said this was a very important case, \u201cbecause it is one more step in correcting what I believe is one of the greatest injustices that has happened in Chicago; more than 40 people were wrongfully convicted in cases related to the same detective \u2014 let\u2019s give these people justice and correct those mistakes.\u201d\n\nNoticias Telemundo requested comments on the Tinajero case and other convictions associated with Guevara that have been overturned. NBC News contacted attorneys for Guevara, the Cook County Prosecutor\u2019s Office, the Chicago Police Department and the Civilian Office of Police Accountability, but it has not received any responses.\n\nGuevara arrested Tinajero in 1999 during the investigations into the murder of Daniel Garc\u00eda. In September 2001, a jury convicted Tinajero, who was sentenced to 40 years in prison. John Martinez and Thomas Kelly were also convicted in the Garcia case.\n\nThey have all been released.\n\nThe main evidence against Tinajero was his own statement and an eyewitness identification. Although Tinajero said in court that Guevara coerced him into making a false statement and although he requested the suppression of that statement, the court denied the motion, according to court papers reviewed by Noticias Telemundo.\n\n\u201cWhen they killed Garc\u00eda, at that moment I was in my house. And I always said it, but they didn\u2019t believe me,\u201d Tinajero said.\n\nAccording to court documents, Tinajero\u2019s defense attorney challenged the eyewitness identification as unreliable \u201cand a product of Detective Guevara\u2019s undue influence,\u201d but that did not prevent Tinajero\u2019s conviction.\n\n\u201cWhat I can say is that adapting to prison, knowing that I was innocent, was the most difficult thing for me,\u201d Tinajero said, who added that because of corruption in the justice system, \u201cI had to serve 25 years in prison. ... I\u2019m not happy with that.\u201d\n\nMaurice Possley, a senior investigator for the National Registry of Exonerations, said Guevara\u2019s case is one of the worst he has analyzed in recent years.\n\n\u201cWhen he became a homicide investigator, he began to incriminate people who he knew were bad actors or who he had a grudge against because perhaps they did not cooperate in his investigations,\u201d Possley said. He cited an example of a woman who confessed to a crime she did not commit after Guevara told her he was going to take away her children.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion, it shows the anarchy that a bad detective can unleash,\u201d Possley said.\n\n'Time for a change'\n\n\u201cIn case after case we see Chicago spend millions of dollars on outside lawyers to defend indefensible cases. And it\u2019s time for a change. It\u2019s time for the city to stop wasting its money on lawyers and spend money on compensating victims of truly egregious misconduct,\u201d said Flaxman, Tinajero\u2019s attorney.\n\nAs has happened with other people exonerated in cases related to Guevara, Tinajero and his legal team are evaluating options to sue the city of Chicago for the damages he has suffered over the last 25 years.\n\n\u201cI would like to see the justice system improve,\u201d Tinajero said, \u201cand I would also like to see the corrupt officers not only receive a pension and retire, but I would like to see them experience everything that I went through in prison.\u201d\n\nThe National Registry of Exoneration databases show that in the cases of the nearly 3,500 people who have been exonerated of serious crimes in the U.S. since 1989, more than half are related to alleged police or prosecutorial misconduct. Experts say coerced confessions, withheld evidence, false testimony and other bad practices that contribute to wrongful convictions are often not punished.\n\n\u201cSixty percent of the cases on the registry are people of color,\u201d Possley said.\n\nWhile in some studies Hispanics are a small number of those who are wrongly convicted, he thinks that does not correspond to the reality he has seen.\n\n\u201cIn many cases they are underrepresented because, at the national level, there are states that classify people incorrectly. So they include them in categories like \u2018white\u2019 or \u2018Black,\u2019 but they don\u2019t specify that they are Latino. That\u2019s why you get the impression that the problem of wrongful convictions in the Hispanic community is low, but that is not the reality,\u201d Possley said.\n\nTinajero is one of 395 Latino people who have been wrongfully convicted and exonerated since 1989, according to the National Registry of Exonerations.\n\nFor more from NBC Latino, sign up for our weekly newsletter.",

    "title": "Human growth hormone shots from cadavers linked to Alzheimer's, study finds",
    "text": "Create your free profile or log in to save this article\n\nCreate your free profile or log in to save this article\n\nFive patients in the United Kingdom have developed Alzheimer\u2019s disease that appears to be the result of contaminated injections they received as children decades ago, according to a new study that could change the way scientists think about the causes of dementia \u2014 and cause anxiety in patients who underwent the same therapy.\n\nAll five patients received injections of human growth hormone from cadavers for several years as a treatment for very short stature, according to the study, which was published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine. Scientists extracted the hormone from the cadavers\u2019 pituitary glands, located at the base of the brain.\n\nWhat the scientists didn\u2019t realize at the time, however, was that in some cases, another substance was extracted as well, contaminating the batches: amyloid-beta protein. This protein is involved in the formation of the hallmark brain plaques seen in Alzheimer\u2019s. Researchers said they can\u2019t fully explain how being exposed to these proteins could trigger the creation of plaques and tangles in the brain that cause Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nHuman growth hormone produced by grinding up a human pituitary gland in a blender in 1965. Jon Brenneis / Getty Images file\n\nAlzheimer\u2019s cases are generally divided into two main groups: cases caused by genetic mutations and those that develop sporadically in the population in people over 65 due to a number of risk factors, such as smoking, obesity and high blood pressure.\n\nThe patients in the new study didn\u2019t fit into those two groups. They developed dementia symptoms between ages 38 and 55. None had genetic mutations linked to early-onset dementia, the study found.\n\nThe study authors said their findings suggest a possible third way for Alzheimer\u2019s to develop: through contaminated medical products.\n\nSome doctors who regularly treat children for hormone-related issues and who were not involved with the research said they were surprised by the findings.\n\n\u201cThis is new information that is not known by the medical community,\u201d said Dr. Kupper Wintergerst, who chairs the American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 section on endocrinology.\n\nOther doctors said they were concerned that a therapy once regarded as safe has caused so much harm.\n\n\u201cTo hear that Alzheimer\u2019s is linked to a medical treatment, that\u2019s disturbing,\u201d said Dr. Dennis Chia, an associate clinical professor of pediatric endocrinology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA.\n\nChristopher Weber, director of global science initiatives at the Alzheimer\u2019s Association, noted that the study was very small. The findings would be more credible if other scientists get similar results in future studies.\n\nWeber said there\u2019s no risk to the general public.\n\n\u201cAlzheimer\u2019s disease is not contagious,\u201d said Weber, who was not involved in the new study. \u201cYou can\u2019t catch Alzheimer\u2019s by taking care of someone with Alzheimer\u2019s. Alzheimer\u2019s disease is not transmissible through the air, or by touching or being near someone with Alzheimer\u2019s.\u201d\n\nStill, he said the study\u2019s findings weren\u2019t entirely new.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve known for a long time that it is possible to create abnormal amyloid buildup \u2014 similar to that seen in Alzheimer\u2019s \u2014 in the brain of an animal by injecting it with amyloid-beta,\u201d Weber said. \u201cWe also transfer human Alzheimer\u2019s genes into animals to initiate abnormal, Alzheimer\u2019s-like processes in their brains.\u201d\n\nCadaver-derived growth hormone was given to 27,000 children worldwide from 1959 to 1985, according to the new study, including about 7,700 patients in the United States. Doctors used hormones taken from cadavers before a synthetic version became available.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that other patients who received cadaver-derived hormones are at higher risk of Alzheimer\u2019s, the study authors said. But they added that they don\u2019t expect to see a huge wave of cases.\n\n\u201cThe actual risk of transmission of Alzheimer\u2019s disease in this context is really very low and these are probably going to be very rare cases,\u201d lead study author Dr. John Collinge, a neurologist and the director of the University College London Institute of Prion Diseases, said at a news briefing Thursday.\n\nCollinge said patients should be aware of the potential risk for Alzheimer\u2019s and, if needed, seek out testing and treatment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible that if we catch people at an early stage\u201d of Alzheimer\u2019s, he said, \u201cthey may be more amenable to treatments that are becoming available.\u201d\n\nChildren being treated for short stature today are not at risk, because doctors have used synthetic growth hormone since 1985.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think people should be alarmed,\u201d said Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, a professor emeritus at Children\u2019s National Hospital who specialized in pediatric growth disorders.\n\nKaplowitz noted that U.S. manufacturers developed a safer way to purify cadaver-derived human growth hormone in 1977, significantly reducing the risk of contamination. Patients treated in the U.S. with cadaver-derived growth hormone after 1977 are likely at very low risk.\n\n\u201cYou would have thought that if this were a big problem, we would have a lot of cases by now,\u201d said Kaplowitz, who was not involved in the new study.\n\nAnother dangerous protein\n\nAlthough Collinge and his team\u2019s earlier research suggested that patients who received cadaver-derived growth hormone could be at risk for Alzheimer\u2019s, they began following the patients because of concerns over a different disease: Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, or CJD, a rare and deadly condition that also resulted from contaminated hormone samples.\n\nCJD is a cousin of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, commonly called mad cow disease. More than 250 growth hormone patients have been diagnosed with CJD worldwide.\n\nDoctors believe patients developed CJD because of hormone samples contaminated with prions \u2014 little-understood proteins that can trigger normal brain proteins to fold into abnormal shapes. Thirty-five patients treated with cadaver-derived human growth hormone in the U.S. have died from CJD.\n\nFor decades, people who had lived in or traveled to the U.K. or other places hit by mad cow disease were banned from donating blood, for fear of passing on the disease. The Food and Drug Administration lifted that ban in 2022.\n\nCollinge said he doesn\u2019t know whether the proteins that appear to have caused Alzheimer\u2019s can be transmitted through blood transfusions or organ donations. A spokeswoman for the American Society of Transplantation said its scientists know of no links between organ transplants and a heightened risk for Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an interesting question,\u201d Collinge said at the news briefing. \u201cIt\u2019s not something we\u2019ve looked at.\u201d\n\nScientists have had evidence for some time that CJD can be transmitted through blood transfusions, and the American Red Cross bars people who received cadaver-derived growth hormone from donating blood.\n\nBut an American Red Cross spokesman said in a statement that \u201cthere is no scientific evidence\u201d that donated blood can lead to an accumulation of amyloid protein in the body or increase the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s. The Red Cross is in close contact with the FDA and other international health agencies that oversee blood safety to make sure its recommendations include the latest science, spokesman Daniel Parra said.\n\nThe new study raises questions about how Alzheimer\u2019s begins. Alzheimer\u2019s may have more in common with CJD than previously suspected, Collinge said.\n\n\u201cThis may have important implications for understanding and treating Alzheimer\u2019s disease in the future,\u201d he said in a statement. While there have been no other reported cases of Alzheimer\u2019s acquired through other medical care, the study \u201cshould lead us to review measures to prevent accidental transmission via other medical or surgical procedures in order to prevent such cases occurring in the future.\u201d\n\nFor more information, patients treated with cadaver-derived human growth hormone in the U.S. can call the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases at 1-800-860-8747 or email healthinfo@niddk.nih.gov.\n\nPatients treated in the U.K. can email the National Prion Clinic at uclh.prion.help@nhs.net.",

    "text": "Shannen Doherty shared a positive update on her treatment for stage 4 breast cancer thanks to what the \"Beverly Hills, 90210\" star called a \"miracle\" treatment.\n\n\"I'm on a new cancer infusion, and after four treatments, we didn't really see a difference, and everybody wanted me to switch, and I just kind of was like we're going to keep going with this and see,\" Doherty said in a conversation with her radiation oncologist, Dr. Amin Mirhadi, on Monday's episode of her \"Let's Be Clear\" podcast.\n\n\"After the sixth or seventh treatment, we really saw it breaking down the blood-brain barrier.

The cancer spread to her brain and bones last year.\n\n\"Every day is a gift, and there are so many new things in the works that I think hope is always there,\" Doherty said on her podcast. \"All I can do is live each day in as much of a positive manner, with a lot of hope, as I can.\"",

    "title": "Unions plan pushback on proposed driverless taxi expansion in L.A.",
    "text": "Create your free profile or log in to save this article\n\nCreate your free profile or log in to save this article\n\nSome labor unions, including the Teamsters, plan to push back against a plan by the self-driving car company Waymo to expand its autonomous car service in California.\n\nThe Teamsters and three other labor organizations are planning a rally Friday on the steps of Los Angeles City Hall to call for stricter regulation of driverless cars, which they say threaten the jobs of people who drive for a living. The Teamsters say they want autonomous car services to have backup human drivers, and they\u2019re supporting a bill in the California Legislature that would grant cities and counties the authority to regulate or block services such as Waymo\u2019s.\n\nWaymo, which operates fleets of autonomous cars for hire in San Francisco and Phoenix, announced plans last month to expand to two additional swaths of California: parts of greater Los Angeles and suburban towns south of San Francisco. The company, which spun off from Google in 2016, said it has more than 50,000 people on its Los Angeles waitlist for free test rides.\n\nThe service is similar to the ride-hailing apps Uber and Lyft, but the Waymo vehicles are driven by self-driving software, with no humans behind the wheel. Waymo employees are available for remote assistance if needed.\n\nWaymo communications manager Julia Ilina stands next to a Waymo driverless taxi in San Francisco on Feb. 15. Terry Chea / AP file\n\nLindsay Dougherty, the Teamsters\u2019 vice president for the western region, said in an interview that automation in driving is a long-term threat to union jobs such as truck driving and package delivery. The Teamsters represent driving workers at some companies like UPS.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely an issue for working people in general but most definitely the Teamsters, who do represent drivers,\u201d she said. \u201cThe ultimate fear of our members is losing these jobs.\u201d\n\nDougherty also said she\u2019s not convinced that the Waymo service is safe. She said she hasn\u2019t ridden in one and wouldn\u2019t unless a backup human driver was present.\n\n\u201cAny vehicle is a weapon, essentially. It is a piece of machinery that can harm not just other drivers but pedestrians,\u201d she said. \u201cI just don\u2019t trust the technology.\u201d\n\nSelf-driving cars have been involved in high-profile deaths. In 2018, a self-driving Uber car with a backup human driver struck a pedestrian in Arizona, killing her. Tesla\u2019s driver assistance system, known as Autopilot, has been associated with 17 deaths, The Washington Post reported last year.\n\nWaymo has said its safety record is far better that than of human drivers, with no traffic deaths and only minor injuries. And even those minor injuries are generally caused not by the Waymo vehicles but by human drivers in other vehicles who fail to stop and then rear-end Waymos, according to the company and documents it has filed with state regulators.\n\nTraffic deaths caused by human drivers are at or near multidecade highs, having surpassed 42,000 in 2022, according to federal regulators.\n\nWaymo vehicles are generally more observant of traffic laws than human drivers are, according to journalists who have ridden in them in San Francisco: They obey speed limits, use turn signals and make full stops at stop signs.\n\nA Waymo representative had no immediate comment Thursday on the labor opposition.\n\nIn a statement last month, Waymo said the regulatory process it follows is already rigorous.\n\n\u201cWe remain committed to our safety-driven, community-first deployment approach that has served our riders well in San Francisco and Phoenix,\u201d it said. \u201cWe look forward to public feedback over the coming months, and continuing our ongoing dialogue with officials and community organizations in LA.\u201d\n\nLast year, the Teamsters supported legislation in California to require backup human drivers for semiautonomous trucking services. The bill passed the Legislature, but Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, vetoed it, saying it wasn\u2019t necessary to ensure safety.\n\nFriday\u2019s rally in Los Angeles is scheduled to include representatives from three other labor organizations: the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, the California Professional Firefighters and the California Labor Federation.\n\nSome labor unions have supported autonomous taxis. Last year, Cruise, a division of General Motors, said it had signed agreements with two local union chapters in San Francisco that represented electrical workers and janitors at Cruise\u2019s facilities. California later revoked Cruise\u2019s permits to operate in the state, accusing the company of having failed to disclose details about a collision involving a pedestrian.\n\nTo move forward with its planned expansions in California and begin charging the public for rides in new areas, Waymo first needs permission from state regulators. Under state law, it doesn\u2019t need the permission of local authorities, but the Teamsters and others support legislation to change that.\n\nState Sen. Dave Cortese, D-San Jose, is sponsoring legislation that would give cities and counties authority over services like Waymo\u2019s. He said it doesn\u2019t make sense for them to be cut out of the process when they already regulate local taxi services.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really trying to return local control to the cities and counties in terms of motor vehicle oversight and basic street safety regulations,\u201d he said in a phone interview. \u201cThe state shouldn\u2019t have absolute control.\u201d\n\nThe bill would give localities wide authority over autonomous vehicle services, including the ability to cap the number of vehicles depending on their impact on congestion.\n\nLike Dougherty, Cortese said he hasn\u2019t ridden in a Waymo and isn\u2019t convinced they\u2019re safe. He said lawmakers and the public are \u201ccompletely dependent\u201d on the company and its competitors to self-report any incidents.\n\n\u201cWhat they\u2019re asking for is the equivalent of Henry Ford establishing his assembly line and selling his Model T, and the government says, \u2018Go ahead and do what you want, because it\u2019s probably safer than a horse and buggy.\u2019 We\u2019ve never operated that way,\u201d Cortese said.\n\n\u201cI know that\u2019s not the sentiment of my constituents \u2014 at least the majority of them,\u201d he added.",

    "title": "Jennifer Crumbley, mother of Michigan shooter, testifies she regrets her son's actions",
    "text": "Create your free profile or log in to save this article\n\nCreate your free profile or log in to save this article\n\nPONTIAC, Mich. \u2014 Jennifer Crumbley, the mother of teenage school shooter Ethan Crumbley, testified Thursday that while \"I don't think I'm a failure as a parent\" and \"wouldn't have\" done anything differently in how she parented her son, she regrets what he did.\n\n\"I wish he would have killed us, instead,\" she said on the stand in her involuntary manslaughter trial.\n\nShe added: \"I don't want to say that I'm a victim, because I do not want to disrespect the families that truly are the victims in this, but we did lose a lot.\"\n\n\"You lost everything?\" her lawyer, Shannon Smith, asked.\n\n\"We did,\" Crumbley said.\n\nHer relationship with her son was the crux of her highly anticipated testimony, which her defense said would show why she \"could have never anticipated\" that he would kill four students and injure several others at Oxford High School in November 2021.\n\nThe trial, which opened a week ago, is an unusual case of a parent of a school shooter facing criminal responsibility.\n\nThe line of questioning by Crumbley's lawyer attempted to deflect the blame from her. She testified that her husband was responsible for storing the gun he had bought their son as an early Christmas gift and that the task \"was his thing.\"\n\nCrumbley also said her son's school failed to tell her about his difficulty staying awake and paying attention in his classes.\n\n\"If you heard your son was having a rough time, what would you do to follow up?\" Smith asked.\n\n\"I would talk to my son and find out what's going on,\" Crumbley said.\n\nShe acknowledged her son was generally worried about his future after high school and would get stressed out, but she said his mental health never alarmed her enough that she felt he needed to see a professional.\n\n\"There was a couple of times when Ethan had expressed anxiety over taking tests, anxiety about what he was going to do after high school, whether it was college, military,\" Crumbley said. \"So he expressed those concerns to me. Not to a level where I felt he needed to see a psychiatrist or mental health professional right away.\"\n\nDuring her testimony, the jury was shown dozens of images from Crumbley's Facebook page of her family spending time together spanning several years.\n\n\"I trusted him, and I felt we had an open door and he can talk to me about anything,\" Crumbley said. \"I thought as a family we were really close.\"\n\nThe trial opened Jan. 25 in an Oakland County courtroom, with both prosecutors and the defense laying out the dynamic between Crumbley and her son, who was 15 at the time of the shooting.\n\nProsecutors argued that she knew of her son's deteriorating mental health and social isolation and that he had access to a gun but that she cared more about her horses than his concerns.\n\n\"Jennifer Crumbley didn't pull the trigger that day, but she's responsible for their deaths,\" Assistant Oakland County Prosecutor Marc Keast said in his opening statement.\n\nBut her defense told the jury that while she was a caring mother, she did not know her son was capable of such violence \u2014 suggesting it was his school that failed to fully inform her and her husband who was responsible for the weapon.\n\nCrumbley's husband, James, faces trial on the same charges of involuntary manslaughter in March.\n\nIf they are found guilty, the Crumbleys each face up to 15 years in prison and a $7,500 fine per charge.\n\nThe trial has centered mostly on the day of the shooting, Nov. 30, 2021.\n\nDuring a week of presenting its case, prosecutors called more than 20 witnesses, including law enforcement officials and school staff members, and showed text message and video evidence, including school video of the shooting itself.\n\nThe video led Crumbley to put her head down and sob.\n\nJennifer Crumbley, left, with her attorney Shannon Smith in the Oakland County courtroom in Pontiac, Mich., on Thursday. Mandi Wright / Detroit Free Press Pool via AP\n\nA day after Thanksgiving, prosecutors say, James and Jennifer Crumbley bought their son a 9 mm Sig Sauer.\n\nJennifer Crumbley testified that Ethan asked her that weekend to take him to a gun range, which was the only place where he was allowed to shoot, she said.\n\n\"It was a fun day,\" Crumbley said. \"I felt good about it.\"\n\nShe added that she \"didn't feel comfortable\" being responsible for storing the gun, which also had a cable lock, but that she hid the bullets after they got home from the range.\n\nThat Monday, a teacher at Oxford High School said she saw Ethan searching online for ammunition, according to prosecutors, and the school left a voicemail for his mother. The following day, a teacher said she had found a note on Ethan's desk with a drawing of a gun and a person who had been shot, along with messages including, \"The thoughts won't stop. Help me.\"\n\nThat discovery prompted the school to summon the parents for a meeting, but school officials testified that they declined to bring him home because they had to go back to work.\n\nThe officials also said that if the parents had informed them that their son had access to a gun, they would have been more authoritative to ensure immediate safety.\n\nEthan would go on to commit the school shooting later that afternoon.\n\nHe pleaded guilty as an adult to murder, terrorism and other crimes and was sentenced in December to life in prison without parole.\n\nCrumbley testified Thursday that the night before the shooting, she had an argument with her son about his grades in math. She was initially upset when she and her husband had to go to the school the next day about the drawing.\n\n\"I was actually kind of angry, because I thought he was, he did that in, like, defiance of us yelling at him about his assignments,\" Crumbley said, \"and here he is drawing pictures on an empty assignment page in geometry.\"\n\nCrumbley then described how she and her husband learned about the shooting later that day. She said that her son had texted her, \"I love you,\" which was out of character at his age, but that she didn't think it was linked to anything nefarious.\n\n\"It was abnormal for him,\" she said.\n\nBut then her husband, who was aware that there had been a shooting at the school, called Crumbley asking her where she had hidden the gun's bullets.\n\nShe said she thought instantly, \u201cOh, my gosh. He got the gun.\"\n\nBut she testified that she didn't believe he was going to harm anyone and that when she texted him \"Ethan don't do it\" an hour after the shooting began, it was for another reason.\n\n\"I yelled in my talk-to-text 'Ethan don't do it' because I thought he was going to kill himself,\" Crumbley said.\n\nFrom then on, the events became a whirlwind, she said, as friends and family members who saw the news reports about the shooting \u2014 and had yet to learn the details \u2014 wanted to make sure her son was OK.\n\n\"That was the hardest thing I had to stomach was that my child harmed and killed other people,\" Crumbley said.\n\nThree days after the shooting, Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald announced involuntary manslaughter charges against the Crumbleys. But authorities had been unable to find them.\n\nThe case took a dramatic twist at the time when the U.S. Marshals Service released wanted posters and offered rewards of up to $10,000 for information leading to their arrests.\n\nCrumbley said Thursday that her \"Facebook messenger was blowing up with threats\" and that because she and her husband felt unsafe, they went to a hotel and later an art studio in Detroit owned by a friend to figure out what to do.\n\nShe said they didn't want to turn themselves in at the police station because of all of the attention and were waiting on advice from her lawyer about how to proceed.\n\nShe then woke up to law enforcement arresting her and her husband.\n\nMuch of Crumbley's testimony involved her defense's trying to knock down evidence that the prosecution had presented earlier in its strategy to portray her as aloof to her son's needs.\n\nProsecutors had shown the jury photos on Crumbley's phone of both her and her husband riding their horses in March 2021. A computer crimes expert had testified that they were taken at the same time that their son was texting his mother about seeing demons in their house, writing \"the house is haunted\" and asking her, \"Can you at least text back?\"\n\nCrumbley didn't write back, according to the message thread, but she dialed her son 90 minutes after he texted in a call that lasted 19 seconds.\n\nShe said Thursday that she had seen the texts but that her son had believed their house was haunted and enjoyed \"messing with us\" because that was his personality.\n\nProsecutors also introduced a witness, Brian Meloche, who was part of the local \"horse community\" and whom Crumbley was having an extramarital affair with for about six months in the spring of 2021.\n\nMeloche said Crumbley relayed her concerns on the day of the shooting that she \"was worried he was going to do something dumb.\"\n\nCrumbley testified Thursday that neither her husband nor Ethan knew about the affair.\n\n\"Do you feel like that affair caused you to neglect Ethan or not spend time with him?\" Smith asked.\n\n\"No,\" she responded, adding that they would mostly see each other in the mornings.\n\nCrumbley's testimony was expected to continue Friday.\n\nSelina Guevara reported from Pontiac and Erik Ortiz from New York.",

    "title": "Medicare to kick off first drug price negotiations, and it could get heated",
    "text": "Create your free profile or log in to save this article\n\nCreate your free profile or log in to save this article\n\nThe government is set to begin negotiating prices on the 10 costliest prescription drugs covered by Medicare this week, setting the stage for a fierce tug of war between U.S. officials and drugmakers as the Biden administration attempts to lower soaring prescription drug costs for older adults.\n\nMedicare provides health insurance coverage to more than 65 million people in the U.S., according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS.\n\nThe negotiations, as mandated by the Inflation Reduction Act, are slated to run through Aug. 1 before final prices are announced on Sept. 1. It's uncharted territory for Medicare, which has never before been able to directly haggle with drugmakers over prices.\n\n\u201cI expect negotiations to be intense,\u201d said Lawrence Gostin, director of the O\u2019Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University. \u201cBig Pharma is likely to dig in its heels and use a variety of strategies, including fierce negotiations.\u201d\n\nA pharmacist holds a bottle of the drug Eliquis at a pharmacy. George Frey / Reuters file\n\nBy Thursday, the CMS is expected to send its first pricing offer to each drug company that makes the 10 selected drugs, said Juliette Cubanski, a Medicare expert with KFF, a nonpartisan group that studies health policy issues.\n\nThe 10 drugs under negotiation are:\n\nEliquis, a blood thinner from Bristol Myers Squibb and Pfizer;\n\nXarelto, a blood thinner from Johnson & Johnson;\n\nJanuvia, a diabetes drug from Merck;\n\nJardiance, a diabetes drug from Boehringer Ingelheim and Eli Lilly;\n\nEnbrel, a rheumatoid arthritis drug from Amgen;\n\nImbruvica, a drug for blood cancers from AbbVie and J&J;\n\nFarxiga, a drug for diabetes, heart failure and chronic kidney disease from AstraZeneca;\n\nEntresto, a heart failure drug from Novartis;\n\nStelara, a drug for psoriasis and Crohn\u2019s disease from J&J;\n\nFiasp and NovoLog, diabetes drugs from Novo Nordisk.\n\nAn analysis published in January by the Commonwealth Fund, a research group focused on health care, found that the U.S. retail prices \u2014 prices charged by pharmacists to patients or insurers before discounts or rebates \u2014 for the 10 drugs were three to eight times higher compared to other countries of similar size and wealth.\n\nAnother report from the Commonwealth Fund, published in September, found that in 2022, more than 1 in 7 older adults with Medicare said that they didn\u2019t fill a prescription because of the high cost of drugs.\n\nThe negotiations will begin in earnest Thursday morning, when Medicare presents its opening price offer for the drugs. Both sides will have the opportunity to go back-and-forth, making counter offers over several months before they agree on a final price, Cubanski said.\n\nThe new prices will go into effect in 2026.\n\nA spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said the Biden administration will disclose only the final negotiated prices, not the opening bids.\n\nJulie Masow, a spokesperson for Novartis, told NBC News in a statement that the drugmaker does not plan to make the government\u2019s initial pitch public.\n\nAllison Schneider, a spokesperson for Novo Nordisk, said the company \u201cintends to evaluate CMS\u2019s initial offer and will decide how to respond.\u201d\n\nThe makers of the remaining eight drugs did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nPrice cuts\n\nIt remains unclear how steep the price cuts will be, said Stacie Dusetzina, a health policy professor at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. The Inflation Reduction Act established a minimum price discount of 25% for a drug that is 9 to 12 years old. For older drugs, the minimum discounts could be as high as 60%, she said.\n\nDusetzina said she expects that if a company is initially asked for a discount of around 25% on the price of its drug, they would likely agree to it.\n\n\u201cThat is the best-case scenario,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s nowhere to go.\u201d\n\nBottles of Xarelto, a blood thinner from Johnson & Johnson. Kristoffer Tripplaar / Sipa USA via AP file\n\nWhile at the lower end, 25% \u201cwould actually be a pretty big discount,\u201d she added.\n\nImbruvica, a blood cancer drug, for example, cost the federal government about $2.9 billion in 2020 alone. A 25% discount would provide the government savings of around $560 million, according to an analysis published in the Journal of Managed Care & Specialty Pharmacy.\n\nThose savings are expected to trickle down to older adults who are prescribed the drugs through lower out-of-pocket costs at the pharmacy counter, said Gretchen Jacobson, vice president of the Medicare program at the Commonwealth Fund.\n\nPeople on Medicare could also see lower monthly premiums, Cubanski said.\n\nAdults on Medicare will likely see more savings in the next several years. In 2027, negotiated prices will go into effect for 15 more drugs, followed by another 15 drugs in 2028 and 20 more in each subsequent year.\n\nOngoing lawsuits\n\nOf course, none of this will happen if the drugmakers are successful in their lawsuits seeking to dismantle the Inflation Reduction Act, Gostin said.\n\nIn June, Merck announced a lawsuit against the federal government over the negotiation provision. Other drugmakers, including Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca, have since filed similar suits. On Wednesday, a district court in Delaware is scheduled to hear oral arguments in the AstraZeneca case.\n\n\u201c\u200b\u200bI see a rough ride for the Biden administration,\u201d Gostin said.\n\nIn a statement, Alex Schriver, a spokesperson for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, or PhRMA, a group that represents the drug industry, said the negotiations are not in the best interests of patients.\n\n\u201cGovernment bureaucrats are operating behind closed doors to set medicine prices without disclosing for months how they arrived at the price or how much patient and provider input was used,\u201d Schriver said. \u201cThis lack of transparency and unchecked authority will have lasting consequences for patients long after this administration is gone.\u201d",

    "title": "James O'Keefe, Project Veritas settle suit over bogus voter fraud claims cited by Trump campaign",
    "text": "Conservative provocateur James O'Keefe and his former organization Project Veritas have settled a lawsuit filed by a Pennsylvania postmaster after the group spread a Postal Service worker's false claims of voter fraud during the 2020 presidential election.\n\nA lawyer who represented Robert Weisenbach, the Erie postmaster who filed the lawsuit in state court, confirmed that it had been settled on undisclosed terms.\n\n\u201cThe only comment I\u2019m allowed to make about it is that the case was filed, was litigated, and settled to the satisfaction of the parties,\u201d attorney David Houck told NBC News.\n\nO'Keefe, who was removed as head of Project Veritas in February 2023, said in a brief statement Monday that he was \"aware of no evidence or other allegation that election fraud occurred in the Erie Post Office during the 2020 Presidential Election.\u201d\n\nProtect Democracy, a self-described anti-authoritarian group that was involved in the suit on Weisenbach's side, said in a statement that the case \u201cwas resolved in a manner acceptable to all parties.\u201d\n\nProject Veritas did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.\n\nO'Keefe and Project Veritas had boosted the claims of Richard Hopkins, a Trump supporter who worked as a mail carrier at the time and claimed that he'd heard Weisenbach make statements about illegally backdating mail-in ballots. Hopkins retracted his statement after Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., cited it in a letter to the Justice Department in 2020.\n\nIn a statement O'Keefe and Project Veritas published Monday, Hopkins said he \"only heard a fragment\" of a conversation between Weisenbach and another supervisor but had \"reached the conclusion that the conversation was related to nefarious behavior.\" Hopkins now says he was wrong.\n\n\u201cAs a USPS mail carrier at the time, I was on heightened guard considering many allegations of \u2018widespread fraud\u2019 plaguing the 2020 Presidential Election,\u201d Hopkins said in the statement. \u201cAs I have now learned, I was wrong. Mr. Weisenbach was not involved in any inappropriate behavior concerning the 2020 Presidential Election. The [Postal Service Office of the Inspector General] investigated and found that neither Mr. Weisenbach nor any other USPS employee in Erie, Pennsylvania engaged in election fraud or any other wrongdoing related to mail-in ballots.\n\n\"I apologize to Mr. Weisenbach, his family, the employees of the Erie Post Office, and anyone that has been negatively impacted by my report,\" Hopkins continued. \"I implore everyone reading this statement to leave the Weisenbach family alone and allow them to return to their normal, peaceful, lives.\u201d\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, in a tweet a week after the election, called Hopkins a \u201cbrave patriot,\u201d and the Trump campaign cited his claims in litigation.\n\nO\u2019Keefe wrote Monday on X that he had \"reported that election fraud had occurred in Erie, Pennsylvania during the 2020 Presidential Election,\" saying the story \"was based on Richard Hopkins\u2019 claim that he had overheard Robert Weisenbach, the Erie Postmaster, direct another USPS supervisor to illegally backdate mail-in ballots.\"\n\n\"Mr. Hopkins has since come to learn that he was wrong \u2014 neither Mr. Weisenbach nor any other USPS employee in Erie, Pennsylvania engaged in election fraud or any other wrongdoing related to mail-in ballots,\" O'Keefe said.\n\nThe settlement comes at a difficult time for Project Veritas, a right-wing group that laid off employees and suspended operations last year. Hannah Giles, who worked with O\u2019Keefe and was its chief executive, announced in December that she was leaving Project Veritas, writing on X that she had \"stepped into an unsalvageable mess \u2014 one wrought with strong evidence of past illegality and post financial improprieties.\" Also in December, a federal judge rejected a First Amendment defense by Project Veritas in connection with an investigation into the theft of a diary belonging to President Joe Biden\u2019s daughter.",

    "text": "Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer expressed optimism Monday over a bipartisan bill that seeks to impose stricter immigration and asylum laws, saying he believes it will pass the Senate despite opposition from hard-right Republicans.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m confident \u2014 \u2018hopeful\u2019 is the right word,\u201d Schumer, D-N.Y., said in an interview on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d when he was asked about the bill\u2019s chances of passing in the Senate. \u201cThis is hard. And our Republican senators \u2014 we need a bunch of them \u2014 are under a lot of pressure from right-wing Trump part of the party.\u201d\n\nSenators released the text of the bipartisan bill Sunday night after months of negotiations. The $118 billion bill, which comes amid record-high crossings at the southern border, includes foreign aid to Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan. Republicans have said they would support aid to those countries only on the condition that it is paired with new policies to restrict U.S. immigration.\n\nThe bipartisan package faces opposition from House Republican leadership and other conservatives, including several members of the House Freedom Caucus. Shortly after senators released the text of the bill, Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said Sunday night on X that \u201cit will be dead on arrival\u201d if it reaches the House.\n\nSchumer said the bill is a \u201ccompromise,\u201d which he added is \u201cthe only way you get important things done\u201d in the Senate. He blamed pressure from former President Donald Trump and his allies for the hard-right Republicans\u2019 opposition to the legislation.\n\n\u201cWill the senators drown out the political noise from Trump and his minions and do the right thing for America?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt\u2019s a crucial question. History is looking down on every one of us right now.\u201d\n\nAsked what happens next if the bill passes the Senate, Schumer listed groups within the House that he argued it would appeal to.\n\n\u201cFirst is a big group of hawks in the middle, and they care about funding Ukraine \u2014 they always have \u2014 and the strategy of Johnson is right now do nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a large number of pro-Israel people \u2014 they care about that. Then there\u2019s a large number of progressive legislators, I\u2019m included, who want to see that Gaza, the people in Gaza, don\u2019t starve and we get that aid to them.\n\n\u201cPlus, there are some who care about Taiwan, and there\u2019s money there to bolster us against China\u2019s aggression there,\u201d he added. \u201cYou know, we\u2019re in an aggressive world, and we got a lot of dictators linking up \u2014 Russia, China, Iran. If we don\u2019t defend ourselves, we don\u2019t want this to be like 1938.\u201d\n\nSchumer predicted that Johnson will eventually face \u201chuge pressure from within his caucus\u201d to pass the bill if it gets through the Senate.\n\n\u201cWell, he\u2019s saying that now because he hopes his nightmare is we pass it in the Senate,\" Schumer said about Johnson's opposition. \"So he\u2019s doing everything he can to thwart us passing it in the Senate. But once we pass it in the Senate, God willing, I think there\u2019ll be huge pressure from within his caucus and without to get this done.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf he put this bill on the floor of this House right now, it would pass,\" Schumer said. \"We\u2019d get a lot of Democratic votes, and we get some good number of Republican votes.\"\n\nIn a joint statement Monday, the top four House Republican leaders \u2014 Johnson, Majority Leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana, Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota and Republican Conference chairwoman Elise Stefanik of New York \u2014 said they oppose the bipartisan border bill \u201cbecause it fails in every policy area needed to secure our border and would actually incentivize more illegal immigration.\u201d\n\nThey cited the proposed expansion of work authorizations without also including \"critical asylum reforms,\u201d what they said were loopholes in the border shutdown authority that would give Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas \u201ctoo much discretionary authority,\u201d insufficient limitations on Biden\u2019s parole authority, and the use of taxpayer funds to house migrants in hotels through a Federal Emergency Management Agency program that provides them with shelter and services.\n\n\u201cAny consideration of this Senate bill in its current form is a waste of time,\u201d they wrote. \u201cIt is DEAD on arrival in the House. We encourage the U.S. Senate to reject it.\u201d\n\nBefore the Senate released the border bill text, Johnson announced Saturday that the House will vote this week on a stand-alone bill to provide aid to Israel. He defended his move in an interview on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d denying that he had proposed the stand-alone aid package to kill the compromise deal in the Senate.\n\n\u201cNo, we\u2019ve made very clear what the requirements of the House were, and that is to solve the problem at the border,\u201d he said, adding that the House has been \u201cawaiting\u201d action from the Senate.\n\nJohnson also denied that Trump, who opposes the Senate\u2019s immigration deal, influenced his decision to push an Israel bill.\n\n\u201cOf course not. He\u2019s not calling those shots,\" Johnson said. \"I am calling the shots for the House. That\u2019s our responsibility. And I have been saying this far longer than President Trump has.\"\n\nIn a post to Truth Social on Monday morning, Trump urged Republicans to vote against the border bill, which he slammed as \u201chorrendous,\u201d and called for a separate bill that does not link to foreign aid.\n\n\u201cOnly a fool, or a Radical Left Democrat, would vote for this horrendous Border Bill, which only gives Shutdown Authority after 5000 Encounters a day, when we already have the right to CLOSE THE BORDER NOW, which must be done,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis Bill is a great gift to the Democrats, and a Death Wish for The Republican Party. It takes the HORRIBLE JOB the Democrats have done on Immigration and the Border, absolves them, and puts it all squarely on the shoulders of Republicans. Don\u2019t be STUPID!!!\u201d\n\nTop Senate Republicans have also begun stating their rejection of the bill.\n\nSen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., a member of GOP leadership as chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, came out against the bill, saying he can\u2019t support the provisions about the border.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t support a bill that doesn\u2019t secure the border, provides taxpayer funded lawyers to illegal immigrants and gives billions to radical open borders groups. I\u2019m a no,\u201d he wrote on X.\n\nSens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah also panned the bill and urged their colleagues to vote against it.\n\n\u201cThis \u2026 is \u2026 INSANE,\" Cruz wrote Sunday night on X. \"On Schumer\u2019s Open-Borders Legislation, Republicans shouldn\u2019t just vote no \u2026 but HELL NO.\u201d\n\nLee wrote Sunday night on X that the bipartisan border bill is \u201ceven worse than we thought.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one who cares about our border security should support it,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt is a betrayal of the American people.\u201d\n\nSenate Minority Whip John Thune, R-S.D., and Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, a former Republican whip, have not commented publicly on the bill.",

    "title": "Half of Asian American and Pacific Islander adults feel U.S. should support Palestinians more, new survey says",
    "text": "Nearly half of Asian American and Pacific Islander adults believe the United States is not supportive enough of Palestinians in the ongoing conflict in Gaza, a new report shows.\n\nAlmost the same percentage said that the U.S. is too supportive of Israelis, according to the survey released this week by AAPI Data/AP-NORC. In comparison, 36% of the general population said the U.S. isn\u2019t supportive enough of Palestinians, a separate AP-NORC poll said.\n\nIgnoring the stances of the Asian American and Pacific Islander community on the issue could lead to trouble for President Joe Biden and the Democratic Party in particular, AAPI Data Director Karthick Ramakrishnan said.\n\n\u201cAsian Americans and Pacific Islanders are electorally consequential in many states,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Democratic Party has to be concerned about where Asian Americans seem to stand on the Israel-Gaza question.\"\n\nThe data also showed that 45% of AAPI adults believe the U.S. is not supportive enough of Muslim communities in the country. When asked about Jewish communities, just more than a quarter said the same.\n\nThe survey featured 1,091 Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander respondents aged 18 and older in the U.S. It was conducted online and over the phone Dec. 4-11 in languages English, the Chinese dialects of Mandarin and Cantonese, Vietnamese and Korean.\n\nRamakrishnan underscored that the findings do not point to a pro-Palestine stance, however. Just 11% of AAPI see Israel as a rival and a similar percentage see it as an adversary. Meanwhile, 40% consider Israel a \u201cpartner to cooperate with\u201d but feel the country doesn\u2019t share U.S. interests and values. Another 36% consider Israel to be an ally.\n\n\u201cThis is not anti-Israeli sentiment that is coming through, but probably a concern about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, and making sure that Palestinian civilians are alive and safe,\u201d Ramakrishnan said.\n\nSince the Hamas attack Oct. 7 \u2014 in which, according to Israeli authorities, some 1,200 people were killed and another 240 were kidnapped \u2014 more than 26,000 people have been killed across the Gaza Strip in the Israeli military campaign. Most of the Palestinian victims are women and children, local authorities say.\n\nRamakrishnan said that one factor behind the community's stance could likely be the way in which many Asian American communities come from histories of colonization.\n\n\u201cThat is an additional dynamic for a lot of Asian Americans who come from colonized countries and who identify as minority or minoritized populations \u2014 it\u2019s to be sympathetic and to find common cause with Palestinians who they see as oppressed people,\u201d he said.\n\nThe survey did reveal some generational differences. AAPI adults ages 60 and older are more likely to see Israel as an ally, compared to their younger AAPI counterparts, at 50% versus 32%.\n\n\u201cEspecially among younger AAPI voters \u2026 for whom Israel-Gaza was of higher importance for younger voters than for older voters. The Biden campaign might lose in some key states,\u201d Ramakrishnan said.\n\nWith growing concerns over the conflict, he said, he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the Biden administration began to react.\n\nThe Biden administration \"could perhaps even push the Israeli government either towards the cease-fire or taking great pains to ensure that deaths are minimal in Gaza moving forward,\u201d he said.",

    "title": "Convoy rally on Texas-Mexico border attracts Trump fans who decry illegal immigration",
    "text": "QUEMADO, Texas \u2014 Trump 2024 flags flew alongside Christian flags as a throng of people converged on a rural Texas ranch to denounce the president and the people who have crossed into the United States from the nearby Rio Grande.\n\nMany of those who arrived at the border town of Quemado on Friday for the \u201cTake Our Border Back\u201d rally said they were convening as Christians who stand against lawlessness and were doing so peacefully. The musical performers, vendors, political signs and colorful clothing on the rally grounds contrasted with the razor wire, camouflage uniforms and weaponry stationed 20 miles south at the section of border in Eagle Pass.\n\nThe group arrived at about 8 p.m. Friday local time and merged onto a two-lane rural road, creating a long queue of mostly personal or rented cars and recreational vehicles.\n\nA participant passes flags and signage during a \"Take Our Border Back\" rally, Saturday, Feb. 3, 2024, in Quemado, Texas. Eric Gay / AP\n\nThey were led by a man on horseback waving the Christian flag \u2014 a white banner with a blue square and red cross in its upper left corner \u2014 three commercial trucks and a few buses, inching one by one through the only open entrance onto the grounds.\n\nThe convoy was first billed as 700,000 trucks that would head from Virginia to three points on the border, but that didn\u2019t materialize.\n\nHowever, people joined along the way in Texas, driving passenger cars, recreational vehicles and trucks towing campers. When they arrived on Texas\u2019 border, organizers said the convoy numbered around 200. NBC News was unable to independently verify that number, but observed at least 100 vehicles.\n\nDorothy Richards, 67, a retiree from New Braunfels, had attended a leg of the convoy\u2019s rally in Dripping Springs, Texas, near Austin, but arrived before the convoy. The Take Our Border Back organizers held their Dripping Springs event at a whiskey distillery, where Richards said free mugs of beer were handed out.\n\nShe carried a Texas flag Friday, but then swapped that out for a sign supporting Texas Gov. Greg Abbott in his face-off with President Joe Biden over immigration. \u201cBiden had his chance,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cGovernor Abbott & TX NG [National Guard] SECURE THE BORDER,\u201d Richards\u2019 sign read.\n\nThe Biden administration and Abbott have clashed over enforcement of immigration laws as Abbott has been sending immigrants allowed to await hearings in the U.S. to Democratic-led cities and has been operating his own border enforcement. Abbott is using the Texas National Guard and state police to apprehend people crossing into the United States illegally and to erect razor wire along the border. Border Patrol agents have said some of the actions are keeping them from doing their jobs.\n\nRichards said the clash over immigration could bring civil war, but she saw it as necessary. \u201cWhat are we going to do? Should we stand back and let it [illegal immigration] happen?\u201d she asked.\n\nThe event could have easily been a Trump rally with flags, MAGA hats and even a cardboard Trump. Some took it further with a hearse with \u201cTrump 2024\u201d on the front door and \u201ccollecting Democrat votes one dead stiff at a time\u201d written in all-capital letters on the rear.\n\nAlma Arredondo-Lynch, 67, of Concan, Texas, wore a rhinestone \u201cWomen For Trump\u201d brooch and wide-brimmed hat as she walked the ranch\u2019s grounds. Friday evening\u2019s rain and lightning had been pushed aside by a bright sun and warm temperatures on Saturday.\n\n\u201cI believe that if we don\u2019t have a border, we don\u2019t have sovereignty. And if we don\u2019t have sovereignty, we aren\u2019t going to have civility,\u201d she said. Drug cartels own and operate the border, she said.\n\nLike several others, she said she was not against people coming to the border, but said they should arrive legally.\n\nThe rally was largely calm with the exception of some clashes with a handful of demonstrators who said they belong to the group Street Preachers. They began protesting late Friday with a bullhorn, but were forced by the convoy and rally organizers to move across the street. They held anti-LGBTQ and Islamophobic signs.\n\nThe organizers used their own bullhorn to separate themselves from the protesters and to tell rallygoers they didn\u2019t agree with the protesters\u2019 views.\n\nBut some rallygoers didn\u2019t distance themselves from anti-immigration rhetoric used by Abbott, Trump and others, which has raised alarms. Trump has said immigrants are \u201cpoisoning the blood of our country.\" Abbott drew some backlash when he said that the state was not shooting people who cross the border illegally because then Biden would charge state officials with \u201cmurder.\u201d\n\nAbbott was planning to host several Republican governors in Eagle Pass on Sunday for a news conference on immigration and the border.\n\nAsked about Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant rhetoric, Scotty Clay of Alpena, Arkansas, who would not give his age, said, \u201cTrump sometimes stirs the pot ... just to get the rouse out of the media.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are at war within our own country. It\u2019s on our southern border,\u201d he said.\n\nDoug Pagitt, a pastor and the executive director of Vote Common Good, was at the ranch and in Eagle Pass over the weekend, too, to counter the claims that conservative and far-right groups constitute the \u201carmy of God\u201d \u2014 as rally organizers have described themselves \u2014 and to support faith leaders who do not agree with them or Abbott.\n\n\u201cWhen we hear people like this trucker brigade say that they are the army of God and they\u2019re espousing things that sound like Christian nationalist ideas, that puts a target on places like Eagle Pass,\u201d Pagitt said, referring to what he said was the belief that Christianity is the default religion for the nation and is what makes the U.S. great.\n\n\u201cA lot of people are here to say that the governor shouldn\u2019t listen to federal law. That sounds a little bit like an insurrection,\u201d he said.\n\nThe convoy may be peaceful, he said, but attracts other groups that want to cause violence. He said he and other faith leaders were advised by Eagle Pass police against holding an outdoor hot dog cook-off and a prayer walk at Shelby Park on Sunday because the police could not guarantee their safety.\n\nStanding across from the ranch entrance Friday afternoon, onlooker Marco Castillo, 29, of Eagle Pass, said the rallygoers should have been in the area in December, when crossings were more numerous.\n\n\u201cWhat is all of this for? For show,\u201d he said, adding that he\u2019d seen Dr. Phil\u2019s helicopter in the skies. \u201cShow.\u201d\n\nHe sees no need for Abbott\u2019s enforcement operation, dubbed Operation Lone Star, to be in Eagle Pass, \u201cbecause look what they brought,\u201d he said.",

    "title": "In 'white' Argentina, TV star Mart\u00edn Ku, who's Argentine Asian, spurs reality check on race",
    "text": "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina \u2014 On Dec. 11, the all-caps phrase \u2018UN CHINO\u2019 \u2014 or \u2018a Chinese\u2019 \u2014 began trending in Argentina on the social media platform X.\n\nThat night, the local spinoff of the \u201cBig Brother\u201d franchise aired the premiere of its latest season. Argentine television watchers were processing their surprise: For the first time in the hit show\u2019s 11-season run, the cast of houseguests included an Asian contestant in the form of 24-year-old Mart\u00edn Ku, the son of Chinese and Taiwanese immigrants.\n\nIt was a seminal moment for Asian Argentine representation in mainstream media.\n\nIn this South American country of 45 million people, no TV show rivals the big-tent appeal of \u201cGran Hermano.\u201d The reality juggernaut is the most-watched program on Argentine airwaves, with mainstream news publications regularly covering the intrigue and machinations of each season as it progresses.\n\nSo when Ku strode into the \u201cBig Brother\u201d house, luggage in hand, it was a resonant milestone.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting for this for years,\u201d said Carlos Lin, 44, an event emcee who has become one of the faces of Buenos Aires\u2019 Chinese diaspora. \u201cIt\u2019s huge.\u201d\n\nFor Carlos Lin, an event emcee, the spotlight on Argentine Asians created by Ku's TV presence is long overdue: \"We've been waiting on this for years.\" Jason Kung\n\nThe inaccurate notion that Argentina is a white nation has widespread buy-in. Just last year, U.S. Rep. Mar\u00eda Elvira Salazar, R-Fla., drew attention after praising Argentina for having \u201conly one race\u201d and being \u201ccompletely homogenous\u201d \u2014 a reference to the country\u2019s perception as white.\n\nIt\u2019s a misconception that is due in part to what experts, including Afro Latino scholars describe as a long-running \u201cwhitening process,\u201d whereby the country\u2019s leaders have boosted a European self-image while collapsing references to racial categories \u2014 the Argentine census bureau failed to collect racial information for much of its history.\n\nIn 1853, Argentina\u2019s first constitution plainly stated that \u201cthe federal government shall foster European immigration.\u201d Fast forward to the present day, a commitment to an exclusively European sense of identity continues to hold sway.\n\n\u201cWe are all descendants from Europe,\u201d the country's right-wing president, Mauricio Macri, said in 2018. In 2021, left-wing President Alberto Fernandez said, \u201cThe Mexicans came from the Indians, the Brazilians came from the jungle, but we Argentines came from the ships.\"\n\nMarginalization \u2014 and ongoing stereotypes\n\nThe idea of an exclusively white Argentina lives on in part because of the thorough marginalization of Argentines of color. That\u2019s especially true of the Chinese diaspora, which according to recent estimates numbers roughly 200,000 people, making it Argentina\u2019s largest non-Latin American immigrant group.\n\nLuc\u00eda Luna Li, 23, was born in the Buenos Aires metropolitan area to Chinese parents. Argentina, like the United States, grants birthright citizenship, meaning that those born in the country are citizens.\n\nLi said she almost never saw someone of Asian descent in Argentine media growing up. Nowadays, she noted, it still isn\u2019t uncommon for her to receive comments on social media that put her Argentine identity in question. On TikTok, she describes herself in her bio as being \u201can argenchina,\u201d a play on words on Argentine and Chinese.\n\nLuc\u00eda Luna Li, whose parents emigrated from China, said she had almost never seen an Argentine of Asian heritage on TV or other media. Courtesy Lucia Luna Li\n\nGiven the reality genre\u2019s widely documented struggles with diversity in the United States, where a \u201cBig Brother\u201d contestant had to be sent home last year for using a racial slur, it is perhaps not surprising that Ku\u2019s pioneering foray into the Argentine reality space caused racial prejudice to rear its head in various degrees.\n\nDuring the season premiere, the show aired a clip of Ku answering icebreaker-type questions, including if he eats asado, the typical Argentine barbecue meal, with chopsticks. Newspaper coverage recapping the show reductively refers to Ku as \u201cthe Chinese.\u201d Earlier this month, another contestant mockingly pantomimed speaking Chinese, and poked fun at Ku\u2019s mother\u2019s Chinese name, in a display many fans found openly racist and xenophobic.\n\nStill, there\u2019s cautious optimism within the Chinese Argentine community that Ku\u2019s star turn on \"Big Brother\" could help bring about positive change.\n\n\u201cIt could help make Chinese folks a bit more accepted,\u201d said Gustavo Ng, a Buenos Aires-based journalist who has written extensively about China-Argentina relations. \u201cBut just Argentinean Chinese. Chinese from China, that\u2019s another story.\u201d\n\nA wave of migration and a new generation\n\nLi\u2019s parents moved from China to Argentina in the mid- to late-1990s. Neither had finished high school and opportunities to climb out of poverty in their hometown were at the time very scarce.\n\n\u201cPeople were hearing that so-and-so went to Argentina and they were doing better than they were at home,\u201d Li said. Her family story is far from unique.\n\nThe bulk of Chinese immigration to Argentina took place through the \u201990s, during a short-lived period of strong economic growth when government policy pegged the Argentine peso to the U.S. dollar. Those migration flows quickly ceased when it became clear that China and Argentina were heading down two starkly divergent development paths. While China\u2019s economy expanded year after year, a generationally severe debt crisis rocked Argentina in the early 2000s, and stability has remained elusive since then. Late last year, frustrations over triple-digit inflation paved the way for a right-wing outsider to rise to the presidency.\n\nAs laid out by Lin and Ng, the Chinese immigrants who settled in Argentina in the 1990s were single-mindedly focused on making money and raising their standard of living. They found opportunity in the supermarket sector, setting up neighborhood grocery stores and convenience stores en masse \u2014 and fast becoming synonymous with that industry. In the contemporary local vernacular, \u201cvoy al chino\u201d has come to mean \u201cI\u2019m picking up groceries.\u201d\n\nIt is difficult to find a Chinese Argentine without a connection to the grocery industry (Ku\u2019s own family manages a supermarket in his hometown of Viedma, near the Atlantic coast). Current estimates put the number of Chinese-run stores nationwide at roughly 11,000.\n\nLin says his parents opened what is likely one of Argentina\u2019s first Chinese supermarkets back in 1989. He started helping out at the store as a young teen, working to smooth out communication between his parents and their customers.\n\n\u201cWhat happens is that many of the Chinese people who run supermarkets don\u2019t speak Spanish that well. So, they don\u2019t really form a bond or a closeness with their clients, who may be people that live right around the corner from them,\" Lin said. \"There\u2019s always a distance.\u201d\n\nNg has a similar view.\n\n\u201cThey came to do business \u2014 the level of integration has historically been very, very low.\u201d he said. Argentine prejudices may also have played a role. According to Ng, Chinese people are seen as among the least \u201cdesirable\u201d type of immigrants to the country, alongside newcomers from poorer parts of Latin America.\n\nBecause Chinese immigrants are so associated with grocery stores \u2014 and so absent from other most aspects of daily life \u2014 many Argentines\u2019 only contact with the Chinese diaspora takes place during frequent but fleeting grocery runs.\n\n\u201cIf you look for Chinese people in sports, in the cultural or artistic sphere, in politics, you won\u2019t find any, with just a few exceptions\u201d Ng said. \u201cFor a Chinese guy to make himself famous on a big TV show, truth is it\u2019s exceptional, super exceptional.\u201d\n\nLin remembers coming up against barrier after barrier in his own attempts to make it onto national TV as a host and news anchor starting in the mid-aughts.\n\n\u201cThe owner of a channel once made a comment like, \u2018How could we have a Chinese guy report the news on camera?\u2019 It was still too strange at that point.\u201d He took opportunities where audiences could hear his voice but not see his face. On-camera opportunities wound up coming via TV programs that dealt specifically with China, including a show that helped viewers learn basic Chinese.\n\nMore visibility \u2014 and hopes for change\n\nNowadays, fully bilingual and bicultural second-generation Chinese Argentines are increasing their community\u2019s visibility through social media. Many of their viral videos on TikTok challenge Argentine negative stereotypes about Chinese people \u2014 and get a laugh in the process. There are jokes about Chinese people looking alike and Chinese shopkeepers being rude and jokes about going from worshipping Buddha to worshipping Messi.\n\nLin says that type of humor is an unavoidable first step for Chinese Argentines trying to break the ice and get into the Argentine public\u2019s good graces. Ku leaned onto that tactic in his \u201cBig Brother\u201d debut as well, pretending he didn\u2019t speak Spanish when he first met the other houseguests, before revealing a perfect command of the language. The more difficult part, according to Lin, is transitioning from being a gag to someone who is seen as being just like anyone else, a normal Argentine.\n\nThe long-running format of \"Big Brother\" is allowing Ku, who has so far survived eight rounds of elimination, to do just that. The longer he stays on the show, the better the chance he will have to make viewers re-evaluate some of the prejudices they might have, Lin says.\n\nLi, the 23-year-old, says she has seen firsthand how the treatment of Chinese people in Argentina has gradually improved over the course of her life.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t treat you like an alien anymore,\u201d Li said.\n\nAs someone who dreams of a media career, she is hopeful Ku\u2019s season on \u201cBig Brother\u201d will create more opportunities for people like her.\n\n\u201cWhen I was kid, my grandfather would say, \u2018Time opens all doors to those who know how to wait,\u2019\u201d Lin said. \u201cMart\u00edn\u2019s casting is the change of an era.\u201d\n\nFor more from NBC Latino, sign up for our weekly newsletter.",

    "title": "President Nayib Bukele in El Salvador heads for reelection despite vote tally delay",
    "text": "Create your free profile or log in to save this article\n\nCreate your free profile or log in to save this article\n\nSAN SALVADOR, El Salvador \u2014 Voters in El Salvador appeared to give Nayib Bukele a second term as president, but a troubled vote tally delayed results in an election that for many hinged on the tradeoff of curtailed civil liberties for security in a country once terrorized by gangs.\n\nProblems with the vote count stalled the effort late Sunday with ballots from only 31% of polling places tallied, a percentage that remained stuck in place on the Supreme Electoral Tribunal\u2019s preliminary results website Monday morning.\n\nEarly Monday, the electoral authority released a statement referring to \u201cmultiple actions that have hampered the development of the transmission activities of preliminary results\u201d and the lack of the paper used to print out the vote tallies at polling places.\n\nIt called on the boards charged with tallying the votes at each polling place to switch to a contingency process that included tallying votes by hand, taking photographs or scans of those manual tallies and turning them into the Supreme Electoral Tribunal.\n\nWhen the Supreme Electoral Tribunal\u2019s digital tallied stopped late Sunday, Bukele had 83% of the vote, far ahead of his nearest competitor\u2019s 7% for the leftist Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front. The electoral site updating the count crashed shortly before midnight.\n\nThat did not stop a jubilant Bukele from declaring a historic margin of victory before electoral authorities had released even the first preliminary figure Sunday evening.\n\nLater, standing on the balcony of the National Palace, he said that the country had made history.\n\n\u201cWhy are there so many eyes on a small (Latin) American country?\u201d he asked thousands of supporters. \u201cThey\u2019re afraid of the power of example.\u201d\n\n\u201cSalvadorans have given the example to the entire world that any problem can be solved if there is the will to do it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe self-described \u201cworld\u2019s coolest dictator\u201d appeared on his way to victory after enjoying soaring approval ratings and virtually no competition. That came despite concerns that Bukele\u2019s government has slowly chipped away at checks and balances in his first term and accusations that he dodged a constitutional ban on re-election.\n\nAfter casting his vote, Bukele made clear that he expects the newly elected Legislative Assembly to continue extending the special powers he has enjoyed since March 2022 to combat the gangs.\n\nHe jousted with reporters, asserting that the election\u2019s results would serve as a \u201creferendum\u201d on what his administration has done.\n\n\u201cWe are not substituting democracy, because El Salvador never had democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the first time in history that El Salvador has democracy. And I\u2019m not saying it, the people say it.\u201d\n\nBukele has been a highly popular leader and only more so since the government began its crackdown on the country\u2019s feared gangs.\n\nUnder a \u201cstate of emergency approved in March 2022, the government has arrested more than 76,000 people \u2014 more than 1% of the Central American nation\u2019s population. The assault on the gangs has spurred accusations of widespread human rights abuses and a lack of due process, but violence has plummeted in a country known just a few years ago as one of the most dangerous in the world.\n\nSara Leon, 48, was among throngs of people who flocked to El Salvador\u2019s previously gang-controlled downtown to celebrate. When she was 23, Leon risked her life to migrate from El Salvador to the United States with her 6-year-old daughter.\n\n\u201cIf the gangs saw a cute girl, they abducted her, abused her and killed her,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want that to happen to my daughter.\u201d\n\nShe returned to her homeland in October because of the \u201cstate of emergency.\u201d She said she now plans to buy a home here and hopes her daughter who has since moved to Toronto will be able to return.\n\n\u201cHe is a genius,\u201d she said of Bukele, tearing up when asked what his administration has meant. \u201cIf he\u2019s a dictator, may we have a dictator for 100 more years.\u201d\n\nBukele\u2019s popularity has also drawn eyes from across the region, and he and his party are increasingly looked to as a case study for a wider global rise in authoritarianism.\n\nThroughout his presidency, Bukele has been accused of taking undemocratic steps that concentrated power in his hands, something observers have worried will only grow with Sunday\u2019s election.\n\nHe showed up in congress with soldiers while attempting to pass his agenda. After his party was victorious in 2021 legislative elections, the newly elected congress purged the constitutional court, replacing judges with loyalists. The new justices later ruled that Bukele could run for a second term despite the constitutional ban on re-election.\n\nBukele arrived on the scene when Salvadorans were craving change, when El Salvador\u2019s traditional parties \u2014 the conservative Nationalist Republican Alliance and leftist Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front \u2014 alternating power for three decades were thoroughly discredited by deep corruption and ineffectiveness.\n\nEarlier Sunday, Bukele waded through a crowd to vote wearing a blue golf shirt and white baseball cap, while supporters chanted, \u201cFive more years! Five more years!\u201d\n\nSmiling, Bukele and his wife dropped their ballots into the box as R.E.M.\u2019s 1987 hit \u201cIt\u2019s the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine),\u201d blared over speakers. Bukele has a habit of trolling his critics.\n\nNot appearing at a single campaign event before the election, Bukele instead plastered videos taped from his couch on social media urging Salvadorans to vote for him so the opposition doesn\u2019t \u201cfree the gang members and use them to return to power.\u201d\n\nHe describes the gangs as a \u201ccancer\u201d the nation had to battle in order to grow.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s coming in El Salvador is a period of prosperity, because now there\u2019s no stopping you from opening a business, no stopping you from studying, no stopping you from working,\u201d Bukele said Sunday.\n\nHe dismissed foreign criticism as promoting failed \u201crecipes\u201d and ignoring his administration\u2019s homegrown solution. He said now that voters had approved him for a second term, external observers don\u2019t have the right to describe his government as undemocratic.\n\nBut Sunday night, Gesenia Garc\u00eda, the 26-year-old owner of a sorbet shop in Ilopango, said she saw things differently. She had hitched a ride with neighbors from the outskirts of the capital to celebrate.\n\n\u201cThis is a moment of happiness because before we lived in corruption and crime,\u201d they said. \u201cHe is the best that God could have sent to this country.\u201d\n\nGarc\u00eda said they had seen friends killed before their eyes under previous administrations. The traditional parties only brought corruption and bloodshed, she said.\n\n\u201cOur president is not unconstitutional because it is something the people made happen at the polls, nobody made me do it,\u201d Garc\u00eda said. \u201cHe is not unconstitutional. The parties of the past are unconstitutional.\u201d\n\nGarcia strolled through San Salvador with 5-year-old son and mother, beaming to be out on streets that not long ago were no-go zones for ordinary citizens. Even without a plan for how to get home, they walked trusting everything would work out.",

    "title": "How Asian American voters could help determine who gets George Santos\u2019 former seat",
    "text": "For decades, political campaigns paid scant attention to Asian American voters: The population was low. The Election Day turnout wasn\u2019t there. Some had language barriers.\n\nBut in the fast-approaching special election to replace scandal-tanked Republican George Santos in New York\u2019s 3rd Congressional District, voters from the Asian American and Pacific Islander communities could help determine the outcome.\n\nAbout 18% of the district\u2019s electorate is Asian American, according to the nonpartisan engagement group APIAVote.\n\nAnd from downing shrimp dumplings to taping Lunar New Year greetings in Chinese, the candidates \u2014 former Rep. Tom Suozzi and Nassau County Legislator Mazi Melesa Pilip \u2014 are openly chasing their support in a district that covers parts of Queens and New York City\u2019s Long Island suburbs.\n\nAn Emerson College Polling/PIX11 survey of district voters released Jan. 18 showed a tight race, with about 45% of voters behind Democrat Suozzi, 42% backing Republican Pilip, 5% supporting someone else and 9% undecided.\n\nWhile Pilip led among white and Latino voters, Suozzi was ahead \u201camong the district\u2019s large population of Asian voters,\u201d 60% to 25%.\n\nRep. Grace Meng, D-N.Y., the first \u2014 and only \u2014 Asian American woman to represent New York in Congress, is stumping with Suozzi. \u201cI try to tell our Asian communities that we have been used to being marginalized, but in this case, we can be the margin of victory \u2014 and that all depends on if they come out to vote,\u201d she says.\n\nOn the trail, Meng said, \u201cWe\u2019ve been having fun with the different, diverse Asian community groups \u2014 dim sum events, Korean barbecue, Korean fried chicken. He\u2019s been going to South Asian restaurants and [on] small-business walks; meeting with religious leaders.\u201d\n\nSuozzi has also campaigned with New York City Council member Linda Lee and with Christine Liu, the first Asian American elected to the North Hempstead Town Council. The campaign said it has advertised with Chinese and Korean newspapers, radio and TV stations, as well as South Asian papers. It also has multilingual campaign literature and is phone banking with speakers of Chinese, Korean and Urdu.\n\nNavkiran Cheema, 28, says he'll focus on the issues for each candidate. Courtesy Navkiran Cheema\n\nMeng hopes the focus on AAPI voters in the district will serve as a model for future campaigns: \u201cWe are always trying to remind candidates on both sides of the aisle how important it is to reach out to the Asian community,\u201d Meng says, \u201cand that there are polls that show that most Asian voters in any given election around the country do not hear from either party.\u201d\n\nWhile many Asian American ethnic groups have leaned Democratic in past elections, Pilip\u2019s team says they\u2019re hardly ceding the AAPI vote to Suozzi.\n\n\u201cAsian voters are of main importance and significance to us,\u201d says Nassau County Republican Committee Chair Joseph Cairo Jr., who hopes the life story of Pilip, an Ethiopia-born daughter of Orthodox Jewish parents who emigrated to Israel at 12 and subsequently to the U.S., may resonate among Asian immigrant communities and voters for whom English is not a first language.\n\nPilip has \u201cbeen meeting with various Asian groups in the community. She has members of her team, volunteers, who are Asian-language speaking. They\u2019re making phone calls,\u201d Cairo says.\n\nMeanwhile the candidate is hitting Lunar New Year festivities in places such as North Hempstead and Oyster Bay and is backed by Ruka Anzai, a Japanese American former candidate for state Assembly, as well as other local lawmakers he says have strong support within the AAPI community, Cairo said.\n\nThe Pilip campaign is using WeChat to reach AAPI voters and expects to do more advertising with ethnic media in the final stretch. \u201cOn Election Day and throughout early voting, there will be Asian poll watchers as well,\u201d campaign spokesman Brian Devine said.\n\nAPIAVote Executive Director Christine Chen says when it comes to New York\u2019s 3rd District, a strong showing could really reverberate \u2014 particularly if the off-season election has a low turnout. At 18% of the registered voters, she says, Asian Americans \u201cshould be considered a margin of victory. They should be part of that equation.\u201d\n\nAs the Pew Research Center noted in a January report, \u201cAsian Americans have been the fastest-growing group of eligible voters in the United States over roughly the past two decades and since 2020. Their number has grown by 15%, or about 2 million eligible voters, in the past four years.\u201d\n\nStill, \u201csometimes I feel like we\u2019re still having to prove ourselves,\u201d Chen says. \u201cSometimes I think that we\u2019re being undervalued and we\u2019re being underestimated for our power and the numbers that we actually have.\u201d\n\nTo mobilize voters in the district, Chen says APIAVote will spend about $100,000 on multilingual mailers and digital ads \u2014 with that effort augmented by \u201csweat equity from volunteers.\u201d\n\nNotably, she says, \u201cmore and more Asian American voters are identifying as independent. \u2026 I don\u2019t think folks are really happy with Democrats or Republicans and the labels. It\u2019s really more about hearing from the candidates about what solutions [you\u2019re] going to provide for my family locally,\u201d whether on the surge of anti-Asian hate, the economy or something else.\n\nOn the Queens side of the district, Navkiran Cheema might also be just the kind of person whose vote both Suozzi and Pilip would both love to score.\n\nThe 28-year-old South Asian engineer, who lives in Whitestone, also isn\u2019t registered with a party, cares deeply about taxation and bail reform \u2014 and hasn\u2019t made up his mind whom to vote for yet.\n\nWhile Cheema has seen some South Asian-language campaign materials, and even says a compelling candidate message could influence his choice in the waning days of the race, he\u2019s more focused on doing his own research than being swayed by the season\u2019s barrage of campaign ads.\n\n\u201cI kind of want to drown out the exterior noise [and] look at the actual policies,\u201d he says.\n\nFor more from NBC Asian America, sign up for our weekly newsletter.",

    "text": "Create your free profile or log in to save this article\n\nCreate your free profile or log in to save this article\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday allowed West Point to continue to consider race in its admissions process for now, rebuffing a request made by a conservative group.\n\nIn a brief order, the court denied a request brought by Students for Fair Admissions, the same conservative group that brought the cases that led to the court\u2019s ruling last year that ended affirmative action in higher education. That decision struck down admissions programs at Harvard and the University of North Carolina.\n\n\u201cThe record before this Court is underdeveloped, and this order should not be construed as expressing any view on the merits of the constitutional question,\u201d the order said.\n\nWest Point, based in New York state, provides higher education for U.S. Army cadets who go on to become officers after graduation. It is one of five such service academies, including the Naval Academy in Maryland and the Air Force Academy in Colorado.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruling included a footnote saying that it did not resolve whether service academies like West Point could continue to consider race in admissions \u201cin light of the potentially distinct interests that military academies may present.\u201d\n\nStudents for Fair Admissions President Edward Blum criticized the decision in a statement Friday.\n\n\u201cIt is disappointing that the young men and women who apply to West Point for the foreseeable future will have their race used as a factor to admit or reject them,\u201d Blum said. \u201cEvery year this case languishes in discovery, trial and appeals means that our nation\u2019s best and brightest young men and women will be classified, sorted, and preferred based on their skin color rather than just on their abilities.\u201d\n\nThe challengers, who have brought a similar claim against the Naval Academy, had asked the court to rule before Jan. 31, which is the deadline for people to apply to West Point for admission this year.\n\n\u201cShould these young Americans bear the burden of West Point\u2019s unchecked racial discrimination? Or should West Point bear the burden of temporarily complying with the Constitution\u2019s command of racial equality?\u201d lawyers for Students for Fair Admissions wrote in court papers. The group says that its membership includes two \u201cfull qualified, but white\u201d West Point applicants.\n\nIn asking the Supreme Court to immediately intervene, the challengers said that West Point\u2019s program is inconsistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling last year. The academy awards preferences to Black, Hispanic and Native American applicants, they said in court papers.\n\nU.S. military leaders have long stressed the importance of racial diversity in leadership positions, in part because the rank and file is itself heavily diverse.\n\nSolicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar said in a court filing that for almost half a century \u201cour nation\u2019s military leaders have determined that a diverse Army officer corps is a national security imperative and that achieving that diversity requires limited consideration of race in selecting those who join the Army as cadets.\u201d\n\nWest Point has been considering applications since August and has already made hundreds of offers, Prelogar said.\n\nLower courts declined to immediately prevent West Point from considering race while the litigation proceeds.",

    "text": "New evidence about an alleged 2018 sexual assault prompted authorities to reopen an investigation involving one former and four current NHL players, Ontario police said Monday. The athletes were arrested and charged last week.\n\nOfficials have not disclosed additional details about the new evidence.\n\nThe Philadelphia Flyers\u2019 Carter Hart, the New Jersey Devils\u2019 Cal Foote and Michael McLeod and the Calgary Flames\u2019 Dillon Dub\u00e9, all 25, and ex-NHL player Alex Formenton, 24, made their first court appearances over video call Monday morning, according to the Ontario court docket.\n\nHart, Foote, Dub\u00e9 and Formenton each face one count of sexual assault. McLeod faces two counts, sexual assault and being \u201ca party to the offense,\u201d which refers to aiding or abetting others in carrying out an unlawful action.\n\nAll five have denied the allegations through their lawyers.\n\nThey are accused of sexually assaulting a woman in June 2018 in a hotel room in London, Ontario, Detective Sgt. Katherine Dann said. At the time, all five were members of Canada\u2019s world junior ice hockey team celebrating their gold medal win at a Hockey Canada event.\n\n\"Our service received a phone call from an individual related to the victim in this matter, seeking advice regarding a sexual assault,\" Dann said Monday. \"As a result of the information disclosed the following day, the report was assigned to the sexual assault and child abuse section.\"\n\nAn initial investigation into the alleged assault that was conducted from June 2018 to February 2019 was closed after officials determined there were insufficient grounds for charges.\n\nIn July 2022, the case was reopened after police said they discovered that additional steps could have been taken and began following new leads and speaking to additional witnesses.\n\n\"I can confirm that some of this evidence was not available when the investigation concluded in 2019,\" Dann said.\n\nDann said she could not specify what the new evidence is because the case is ongoing.\n\nThe five defendants, who have denied the allegations, were summoned to surrender last week when the charges were filed, according to documents filed in an Ontario court.\n\nA civil suit was filed in 2022 regarding the same 2018 incident. It accused eight players from the 2018 world juniors team of sexually abusing and assaulting a 20-year-old Ontario native referred to as E.M., according to Ontario Superior Court of Justice records.\n\nThe plaintiff dropped the suit after she reached a settlement with the defendants in May 2022, according to her former lawyer. She initially sought $3.55 million in damages. Details of the settlement have not been disclosed.\n\n\"It takes an incredible amount of courage for any survivor of sexual assault to report to the police and participate in the criminal justice system. That is certainly true for E.M. Yet she remains committed to see this process through,\" the woman's legal representative, Karen Bellehumeur, said in a statement provided to police.\n\nEach of the players in the 2022 suit was identified as \u201cJohn Doe\u201d in court records, and police did not specify whether the NHL players charged last month were the same ones named in the civil suit.\n\nLawyers representing the five charged athletes said their clients were not guilty and looked forward to clearing their names in court.\n\nFormenton, 24, who played for the NHL\u2019s Ottawa Senators in 2017, took an indefinite leave of absence from the Swiss hockey club Ambr\u00ec-Piotta on Jan. 24.\n\nHart, Foote, McLeod and Dub\u00e9 also took indefinite leaves of absence amid reporting about the investigation. In a team statement, the Calgary Flames said they were not aware of pending charges against Dub\u00e9 before they granted his leave of absence.\n\nThe NHL announced the charges in a news release Monday, adding that it conducted its own 12-month investigation into the allegations.\n\n\u201cWe had concluded the investigatory portion of our process to the extent we could, and we were working with the NHL Players\u2019 Association to analyze the information we had, create a process to move forward and then determine what was an appropriate response when the news of the impending charges broke last week,\" NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said.\n\nBettman said he does not expect the four NHL players to return for the season, but he would not comment on whether the NHL investigation yielded a conclusion into wrongdoing on their behalf.\n\nHockey Canada said it also cooperated with the London Police Service throughout its investigation.\n\nThe organization held a hearing to determine whether the five defendants breached Hockey Canada\u2019s code of conduct in November and, if so, what sanctions they should receive.\n\nMeanwhile, the players are suspended from playing, coaching, officiating or volunteering with Hockey Canada.\n\n\u201cIn the past we have been too slow to act and that in order to deliver the meaningful change that Canadians expect of us, we must work diligently and urgently to ensure that we are putting in place the necessary measures to regain their trust,\u201d Katherine Henderson, the president and CEO of Hockey Canada, said in a news release Monday.",

    "title": "Oklahoma bill would ban state agencies from celebrating Pride Month",
    "text": "A bill introduced in the Oklahoma Legislature on Monday would bar state agencies from celebrating LGBTQ Pride Month or displaying rainbow Pride flags on state property at anytime of year.\n\nOklahoma\u2019s \u201cPatriotism Not Pride Act,\u201d introduced by Republican state Rep. Kevin West, would prohibit state agencies from using public funds to \u201cdevelop, organize, administer, engage in, promote, or endorse any activity, including any event, initiative, official communication, social media post, educational program, or public campaign, that aims to promote or recognize Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer and Intersex Pride Month or any event with a similar theme.\u201d\n\nIf enacted, the bill would trigger an immediate state of emergency \u201cnecessary for the preservation of the public peace, health or safety\u201d and would also ban any flag \u201cthat represents sexual orientation or gender identity\u201d on state property or grounds.\n\nThe legislation, sponsored by West and Republican state Sen. David Bullard, is among the first to target the use of state funds for Pride initiatives and celebrations. So far this year, lawmakers in at least two other states \u2014 Florida and Tennessee \u2014 introduced bills that would ban rainbow Pride flags in schools. Florida\u2019s bill would also prohibit government employees, including lawmakers, from displaying rainbow flags.\n\nWest and Bullard did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nNicole McAfee, executive director of Freedom Oklahoma, an LGBTQ advocacy group, said the bill is \"clearly designed to chill speech, and further disrupt the ability of Oklahoma agencies to serve\" LGBTQ Oklahomans.\n\n\"We\u2019re everywhere \u2014 small towns, big cities, on tribal land, and everywhere in between,\" McAfee said in a statement to NBC News. \"We make up communities, and even work for the state. You can\u2019t ban us or disappear us, and it\u2019s a shame that Rep. Kevin West is continuing his obsessive focus on targeting and isolating 2SLGBTQ+ Oklahomans with [this] latest attack. And yet, we\u2019ve always been here and will always be here, during pride and beyond.\"\n\nThe bill is part of a larger wave of legislation targeting LGBTQ people, both in Oklahoma and nationwide. So far this year, state lawmakers have introduced nearly 400 such bills, and Oklahoma lawmakers have introduced 54 of them, the most of any state so far, according to the American Civil Liberties Union, which is tracking the legislation.\n\nLGBTQ Pride Month was first recognized in June 1970, to commemorate the 1969 Stonewall uprising in New York City, which is widely credited as a turning point in the modern gay rights movement. President Bill Clinton was the first president to recognize the month in 1999 when he declared June \u201cGay and Lesbian Pride Month.\u201d\n\nThe Pride flag, which was introduced at the 1978 Gay Freedom Day march in San Francisco, has increasingly been the target of criticism and vandalism over the past two years.\n\nIn June, three men damaged Pride flags outside of the Stonewall National Monument in New York, and a Pride flag was burned outside of a city hall in Arizona. In February of last year, a woman set a Pride flag on fire outside of a New York City restaurant.

It would not detail the reason behind the investigation.\n\n\u201cAfter being made aware of certain recent allegations, the company launched an independent investigation. This process, which is already underway, is being carried out by an external specialist barrister,\u201d Red Bull said in a statement. \u201cThe company takes these matters extremely seriously and the investigation will be completed as soon as practically possible. It would not be appropriate to comment further at this time.\u201d\n\nThe statement came after allegations were published in the Dutch publication De Telegraaf.\n\nHorner has denied any wrongdoing, according to international media reports.\n\nHorner did not immediately respond to requests for comment sent through social media and to a Hollywood agency that represents him as a paid speaker. Formula 1 also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nRed Bull is the reigning constructors' champion in the world's premier auto racing series.\n\nIn the 2023 season, Red Bull driver Max Verstappen blew past competitors for a third drivers' championship in a row, and the team won the constructors' title for the second year in a row.\n\nHorner, 50, has led Red Bull since 2005, developing a reputation for having sharp elbows but enjoying extraordinary success, including four drivers' championships with Sebastian Vettel from 2010 to 2013 before Verstappen's three-peat from 2021 to 2023. It has won six constructors' championships on Horner's watch.\n\nHe married pop star Geri Halliwell of Spice Girls fame in 2015. Last year he was bestowed the honor of Commander of the Order of the British Empire.\n\nLondon-headquartered Formula 1 has seen increasing success in the U.S., a market that it had struggled to penetrate for years. The first race of the 2024 season is scheduled to take place in Bahrain on March 2.\n\nThe league held three races in the U.S. in 2023, added an American driver and saw domestic viewership grow in recent years. It is scheduled to host the three U.S. races again this year \u2014 in Miami, Austin, Texas, and Las Vegas.\n\nLast year, ESPN, which televises the races, said each race's domestic television audience in 2021 drew nearly 1 million viewers on average, and that grew 28% in 2023.\n\nSince 2019, the Netflix show \"Formula 1: Drive to Survive\" has also made a splash globally, and Horner has loomed large in the docuseries, which has pitted him against other team bosses as each season progresses.",

    "title": "Hong Kong fans demand refund after Lionel Messi sits out game",
    "text": "Speaking to reporters Sunday after the match, Inter Miami head coach Gerardo Martino acknowledged fans\u2019 disappointment but said he didn\u2019t want to risk worsening the injuries of Messi, 36, and his teammate Luis Su\u00e1rez of Uruguay, 37, who also sat out the game.\n\nInter Miami has been on a global tour of exhibition games ahead of its regular season, which starts Feb. 21. Messi and his teammates had arrived in Hong Kong on Friday from Saudi Arabia and are due to play again in Japan on Wednesday.\n\nFans traveled from mainland China and other parts of Asia to see Messi, who hadn\u2019t played in Hong Kong since 2014.\n\nZhang Yiyi, 22, an admissions counselor from the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou, said her dream of seeing Messi play in person had been \u201cshattered.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have complicated feelings,\u201d she said. \u201cI truly wanted to see his magical power firsthand, to fulfill a dream of being a fan for 14 years.\u201d\n\nYin Chao, 36, an advertising and marketing professional, paid 2,980 Hong Kong dollars ($380) for a ticket and took time off from his job in Shanghai just to see Messi play, noting that there may be few opportunities left for him to personally witness the talents of aging, injury-plagued stars such as Messi and Su\u00e1rez.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the post-match remarks made by the host and Beckham that we\u2019re truly feeling a bit angry about,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the face of boos from the entire crowd, [they] seemed to just be going through the motions and not responding at all.\u201d\n\nThe game drew a sellout crowd of 40,000 people, many of whom traveled from mainland China and elsewhere in Asia. Louise Delmotte / AP\n\nMichel Lamuni\u00e8re, Tatler Asia\u2019s chairman and chief executive, said the company\u2019s contract with Inter Miami required that Messi and other high-profile players participate in the game unless they were injured.\n\nHe said that the official team sheet submitted before the game Sunday listed Messi and Su\u00e1rez as substitutes and that \u201caccordingly, Tatler Asia had every expectation that both would play.\u201d\n\nLamuni\u00e8re said that Tatler Asia \u201cimmediately informed the government\u201d when it learned at halftime that Messi would be unable to play because of injury and that it asked Inter Miami to have Messi to address the fans instead, \u201cto no avail.\u201d\n\nLamuni\u00e8re did not mention the possibility of refunds or take questions from reporters at the news conference.\n\nHong Kong sports minister Kevin Yeung said earlier that the government\u2019s contract with Tatler Asia required Messi to play at least 45 minutes, \u201csubject to fitness and safety considerations.\u201d\n\nYeung said that Tatler Asia had confirmed before the match that Messi would play in the second half and that the government was not told he would not be playing until 10 minutes before the end of the game.\n\n\u201cWe therefore immediately requested them to explore other remedies, such as Messi appearing on the field to interact with his fans and receiving the trophy,\u201d Yeung said. \u201cUnfortunately, as you all see, these did not work out.\u201d",

    "title": "Silicon Valley county declares loneliness a health emergency",
    "text": "Loneliness is officially a health emergency in California's San Mateo County, which is located in the San Francisco Bay Area and includes part of Silicon Valley.\n\nThe county's Board of Supervisors passed a resolution on Tuesday that declared loneliness a public health crisis and pledged to explore measures that promote social connection in the community.\n\nIt\u2019s the first county in the U.S. to make such a declaration.\n\nThe resolution doesn\u2019t directly set aside funds for programs to reduce loneliness; rather, it signals the county's commitment to addressing the issue and validates residents' experiences, said David Canepa, the Board of Supervisors\u2019 vice president, who introduced the legislation.\n\n\"What we're trying to do is to really get people out of the corners and say, 'Hey, look, there are a lot of people who are feeling like you. You're not alone. And moving forward, here are some of the things that we can do to support you,'\" he said.\n\nCanepa added that the measure was partly inspired by efforts in the U.K. and Japan, which have each appointed national ministers to address loneliness. He was also influenced by conversations with his staff about the links between loneliness and smoking and diabetes, as well as an advisory from Surgeon General Vivek Murthy in May that urged governments to prioritize strategies to promote social connection.\n\nMurthy wrote Friday in a post on X that he was grateful to San Mateo for leading the charge.\n\nAround 17% of U.S. adults in a Gallup poll in February 2023 said they had experienced loneliness the day prior. Canepa said the rate in San Mateo is higher, pointing to a county-led survey in 2022 \u2014 the latest data available \u2014 which found that 45% of residents were struggling with loneliness and isolation.\n\nAn abundance of research has outlined serious health consequences associated with loneliness, including an increased risk of dementia, depression, anxiety, heart disease and stroke.\n\nA November study found that people in the U.K. who lived alone and were not visited by friends or family had a 39% increased risk of premature death compared with people whose loved ones visited daily. An analysis published in 2010, meanwhile, found that social relationships \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 had a greater influence on the risk of death than obesity.\n\nRelative to white people, Black people face a higher risk of premature death linked to social isolation. Older adults have a higher risk of loneliness in general, since they are more likely to live alone or have chronic illnesses that limit their mobility or leave them homebound.\n\nCanepa said San Mateo has a large share of older residents, many of whom became especially isolated during the pandemic. People ages 65 and up make up more than 18% of the county's population, compared with the state average of 16%.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of a perfect storm for older adults right now,\u201d said Jennifer Steele, the CEO of Meals on Wheels San Francisco, an organization that delivers hot meals to seniors in northern San Mateo County.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t live close to their loved ones anymore,\" she said. \"Sometimes people have outlived their loved ones in some cases. Your social circle shrinks after retirement. It\u2019s harder for people to make friends.\u201d\n\nAround 45% of the seniors served by Meals on Wheels in northern San Mateo live alone, according to the organization.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re often the only people that they may see in a week,\u201d Steele said. \u201cIt\u2019s a crisis for a lot of the people that we serve.\u201d\n\nCanepa said he also worries about loneliness among teenagers and young adults in San Mateo for two reasons. One is that they\u2019re frequently on social media, and research has shown that heavy social media use can increase feelings of loneliness. Another is that Silicon Valley\u2019s high-achieving atmosphere may put stress on teens.\n\n\u201cYou have Stanford, which is in Palo Alto right next to our county line. You have all these educational institutions. People are dealing with, \u2018Oh my God, I have to fill out my college recommendation. Oh, my goodness, what school am I going to get accepted to?\u2019 There\u2019s so much pressure on our young people,\u201d he said.\n\nCanepa said he has several ideas for how to improve social connections in San Mateo \u2014 among them, investing in infrastructure to make neighborhoods more walkable and partnering with social media platforms headquartered there, like Meta, to encourage residents to get outside or join community meetups. He also wrote a letter to California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Tuesday calling for a state-appointed \"minister of loneliness.\"\n\nA county fund subsidized by sales tax could help finance some of these efforts, Canepa said. The fund allocates $47 million annually for new community initiatives, including around $10 million for mental health initiatives. Canepa\u2019s office is seeking proposals from organizations that fit those categories.\n\nBut it\u2019s difficult to predict what will actually ease loneliness, said David Sbarra, a psychology professor at the University of Arizona. While scientists have a good understanding of the downstream effects of loneliness, he said, they don\u2019t have a clear picture of all the factors that contribute to it.\n\nSbarra said treating loneliness as purely a mental health issue can ignore systemic factors that make it hard to socialize. For instance, people who work two jobs have less time to spend with friends or family, he said.\n\n\u201cIf local governments increase the minimum wage, you might do more for loneliness than getting people to reappraise difficult events in their life,\" Sbarra said.\n\nMurthy's advisory outlined several strategies to encourage socialization. One is policy measures like accessible public transportation and paid family leave that make it easier for people to spend time with one another. Another is investment in community spaces like parks, libraries and playgrounds. Health care providers could also ask the patients they see if they're feeling lonely.\n\nBut Sbarra said there's still a debate as to whether loneliness is an epidemic in the U.S., as Murthy has said. The same Gallup poll last year found that loneliness in adults had declined since 2020 and early 2021. Sbarra said people may start to feel less lonely as they re-adjust to social activities post-pandemic.\n\nNevertheless, he said, it's important for governments to see socialization as a public health priority.\n\n\u201cThinking of your relationships as important to your health, as you do physical activity, diet and sleep is really the key messaging here,\u201d he said.",

    "text": "Create your free profile or log in to save this article\n\nCreate your free profile or log in to save this article\n\nBlack women who develop high blood pressure before age 35 may have triple the risk of having a stroke by middle age, new data suggests.\n\nThe findings come as the medical community has noted with concern that the rates of stroke are increasing among middle-aged adults, while stroke rates in older individuals have been steadily decreasing over decades, according to lead study author Dr. Hugo Aparicio, an associate professor of neurology at Boston University. The study will be presented next week at the American Stroke Association\u2019s international conference in Phoenix.\n\n\u201cThe message needs to go out that hypertension and stroke are not diseases of the elderly,\u201d Aparicio said. \u201cThese are things that can happen to younger people \u2014 and that Black women in particular have to be aware of the increased risk and advocate for themselves.\u201d\n\nBlack women are twice as likely to experience a stroke compared to white women, and 50% more likely to have high blood pressure, according to the Office of Minority Health.\n\nStrokes are more common in Black Americans than any other racial group in the U.S., the American Stroke Association says. Death rates are also higher.\n\nDr. Amber Johnson, a cardiologist and assistant professor of medicine at the University of Chicago, called the data in the study \u201calarming\u201d but said she\u2019s not surprised.\n\n\u201cI tend to see a lot of younger, Black women and there are higher rates of hypertension that I\u2019m seeing,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nIn the new study, which has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal, Aparicio and his colleagues looked at data from nearly 47,000 women in the Black Women\u2019s Health Study, which has tracked the health of a huge group of Black women since 1995.\n\nAll of the women were stroke-free at the beginning of the study, and were followed for up to 23 years. The researchers looked at what age women developed high blood pressure \u2014 in this case, based on when they started treatment for it \u2014 and also looked at whether they had a stroke during the study period.\n\nThey found that compared to women who didn\u2019t have high blood pressure, Black women who developed high blood pressure before 35 had 3.1 times the risk of having a stroke by middle age. Those who developed high blood pressure before 45 had 2.2 times the risk of stroke, and high blood pressure from ages 45 to 64 was tied to a 1.69 times higher risk of stroke.\n\nA stroke is a \u201cvery devastating event\u201d that can cause permanent damage to the brain and permanently alter a person\u2019s speech and mobility, said Dr. Anais Hausvater, a cardiologist at NYU Langone Health in New York City. The study urges Black women to see their doctor and get their risk factors checked early, she said.\n\n\u201cA lot of people don\u2019t go to see a doctor in their 30s because they\u2019re presumed to be healthy,\u201d Hausvater said. \u201cThey don\u2019t feel any symptoms because hypertension is a silent disease. So, people often don\u2019t know that they have hypertension.\u201d\n\nJohnson said that factors like underdiagnosis and a lack of treatment also put many Black women at risk of developing hypertension and stroke.\n\nWhile lifestyle choices like diet and smoking can affect blood pressure, many patients may not recognize that hypertension can also be inherited, she said.\n\nExperts said that lifestyle changes, like increasing physical exercise, limiting salt and eating healthy foods, can help decrease risk.\n\nThe sooner doctors treat hypertension, the sooner patients can lower their risk of stroke and heart disease, Hausvater said.\n\nScreening for high blood pressure and controlling blood pressure levels are some of the prime elements for preventative care, \u201cbefore people actually have a stroke,\u201d Arapicio said.\n\n\u201cBy the time somebody has a stroke, it\u2019s too late,\u201d he said.",

    "text": "Create your free profile or log in to save this article\n\nCreate your free profile or log in to save this article\n\nInside a cave beneath a medieval German castle, researchers have discovered a pit of bones that they say unlock secrets of the earliest humans.\n\nThe remains \u2014 buried in layers of soil in the collapsed cave \u2014 included the genetic material of cave bears, hyenas and 13 bones of early humans who died 45,000 years ago.\n\nThe findings \u2014 which were described in a trio of papers published Thursday in the journals Nature and Nature Ecology & Evolution \u2014 show that early humans ventured farther north earlier than scientists had realized, that they could craft spear-shaped tools and that they then had the wherewithal to thrive in temperatures far more frigid than the climate today.\n\nThe discoveries, which were made possible because of the development of new DNA technology, are reshaping how scientists understand the time when both humans and Neanderthals walked the European continent.\n\n\u201cBecause of the age of this site and location, we know Neanderthals and humans quite definitively had a large overlap,\u201d said Elena Zavala, a paleo and forensic geneticist at the University of California, Berkeley, who helped author the three studies. The species most likely roamed the same geography for hundreds, perhaps thousands, of years.\n\nA fragment of human bone from the cave in Ranis, Germany. Tim Sch\u00fcler via Springer Nature\n\nThe discoveries could bring scientists closer to understanding why Neanderthals ultimately died out and what role humans played in their demise.\n\nJohn Hawks, a University of Wisconsin-Madison paleoanthropologist who studies ancient human relatives but was not involved in this research, said the study helps solidify the theory that patches of different human cultures were developing as Neanderthals neared their end.\n\n\u201cThese groups are exploring. They\u2019re going to new places. They live there for a while. They have lifestyles that are different,\u201d he said of the early humans. \u201cThey\u2019re comfortable moving into areas where there were Neanderthals.\u201d\n\nThe discoveries were possible only because previous researchers left a stone unturned. Archaeologists in the 1920s and the 1930s previously excavated the Ilsenh\u00f6hle cave, below the Ranis Castle in Germany\u2019s Thuringia region. The castle was built above the cave long before any excavation.\n\nAt that time, the scientists hit a more than 5-foot-thick rock, which blocked them from burrowing into key layers of the collapsed cave.\n\nIn 2016, armed with modern digging technology and new forms of analysis, the researchers returned. About 24 feet below the surface, they found layers that contained leaf points \u2014 which are like spear points \u2014 and human bone fragments.\n\nThe discovery of human bone fragments sent the researchers digging through the material excavated about nine decades ago \u2014 in which they found additional skeleton fragments.",

    "title": "CDC warns that Neptune's Fix \u2014 'gas station heroin' \u2014 may contain synthetic pot",
    "text": "The highly addictive and dangerous supplement Neptune\u2019s Fix \u2014 also known as gas station heroin \u2014 may be contaminated with different types of synthetic pot, chemicals that have been linked to life-threatening effects such as seizures, brain swelling and hallucinations, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Thursday.\n\nThe CDC\u2019s findings were based on a 2023 investigation of 17 adults in New Jersey who had severe reactions after consuming Neptune\u2019s Fix or other products that contain tianeptine. Of them, 13 were hospitalized in intensive care.\n\nTianeptine, an antidepressant that can mimic the euphoric and sedative effects of opioids, is sold as a dietary supplement at gas stations and convenience stores across the United States. It\u2019s often marketed for pain relief, depression or anxiety. It\u2019s approved in some European, Asian and Latin American countries, but not in the U.S.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration doesn\u2019t approve dietary supplements, which means they aren\u2019t reviewed for safety or effectiveness. In January, House lawmakers called on FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf to crack down on the use of tianeptine.\n\nNeptune's Fix. FDA\n\nDoctors in New Jersey \u2014 which says it is currently seeing a dramatic increase in reports of poisonings in adults who have consumed tianeptine \u2014 tested six samples of Neptune\u2019s Fix consumed by two of the patients. In addition to tianeptine, the products also contained kavain, a substance used for anxiety, as well as two different types of synthetic pot.\n\n\u201cIt was a surprise to find those compounds in there at all,\u201d said the study\u2019s senior author Dr. Diane Calello, the medical director of the New Jersey Poison Control Center. \u201cThat\u2019s probably not what the people who bought those products were looking for.\u201d\n\nShe said it is not yet clear whether all 17 patients, who ranged in age from 28 to 69, were exposed to the synthetic pot, which can often cause unpredictable but severe side effects, including seizures and coma.\n\nMultiple patients experienced high blood pressure and seizures, as well as irregular or rapid heartbeats, and at least one patient had a heart attack, according to the CDC report. Among the 13 admitted to the ICU, seven had to be intubated, according to the report. No deaths were reported.\n\nDr. Pieter Cohen, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School who studies the regulation of supplements, called the reported symptoms \u201cdramatic and alarming.\u201d\n\n\u201cUsually we might see something like this in 1 in 100 poisonings,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s potentially an incredibly potent mixture of drugs.\u201d\n\nOn Jan. 24, the FDA warned that the products had been linked to serious side effects including seizures, loss of consciousness and death. The FDA alert didn\u2019t mention synthetic pot, although tianeptine can also cause serious side effects, including rapid heart rate, vomiting, agitation, confusion and hallucinations. The FDA first warned consumers not to buy or use Neptune\u2019s Fix in November, noting that the vials could contain other harmful ingredients.\n\nIn January, Neptune Resources, the maker of Neptune\u2019s Fix, agreed to voluntarily recall its products, which include Neptune\u2019s Fix Elixir, Neptune\u2019s Fix Extra Strength Elixir and Neptune\u2019s Fix Tablets.\n\nDr. William Rushton, a medical toxicologist and director of the Alabama Poison Information Center, said he and his colleagues began sounding the alarm about Neptune\u2019s Fix in his state in 2019. Some patients were admitted to ICUs with symptoms of withdrawal.\n\nThe problem is now growing, he added, with more reports of people consuming the product in the Northeast.\n\nCohen said that there needs to be more regulations around supplements in the U.S., noting that the FDA\u2019s current power is \u201cvery limited.\u201d\n\n\u201cConsumers remain at risk when they consume dietary supplements here in the United States,\u201d he said.",

    "title": "Behind Elon Musk\u2019s brain chip: Decades of research and lofty ambitions to meld minds with computers",
    "text": "It wasn\u2019t the first tiny device to be implanted in a human brain. Still, Elon Musk\u2019s announcement on Monday turned heads in the small community of scientists who have spent decades working to treat certain disabilities and conditions by tapping directly into the body\u2019s nervous system.\n\n\u201cGetting a device into a person is no small feat,\u201d said Robert Gaunt, an associate professor in the department of physical medicine and rehabilitation at the University of Pittsburgh. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think even Elon Musk would have taken on a project like this if it were not for the research and demonstrated capability over decades in neuroscience.\u201d\n\nMusk\u2019s announcement was sudden and offered little information beyond the news itself: \u201cThe first human received an implant from @Neuralink yesterday and is recovering well. Initial results show promising neuron spike detection.\u201d\n\nMany scientists applauded Neuralink\u2019s announcement, while also cautiously noting that the company\u2019s clinical trial is in very early stages and not much information has been released publicly. Still, researchers said Neuralink has made significant gains and is doing exactly what startups are good at: taking what has been learned through basic science and trying to make a real, viable product.\n\nIt\u2019s too soon to know if Neuralink\u2019s implant will be effective in humans, but the company\u2019s announcement is an \u201cexciting development,\u201d said Gaunt, whose own work focuses on using implants \u2014 devices known as brain-computer interfaces \u2014 to restore motor control and functions like people\u2019s sense of touch.\n\nHe said Neuralink\u2019s new milestone is jump-starting an industry that has already undergone rapid advancement in the last 15 years.\n\nThe first brain-computer interface was implanted into a human in the late 1990s, research that was led by a pioneering neurologist named Phil Kennedy.\n\nThe idea was that these devices could tap into the brain circuitry that remains intact after injury to perform basic movements and functions. For instance, when a person thinks about moving their hands or watches someone else move their hand, a lot of the same neurons in the brain are active as if they performed the movement themself, said Jennifer Collinger, an associate professor in the department of physical medicine and rehabilitation at the University of Pittsburgh.\n\n\u201cYou can find patterns of activity in the neural data that correlate with those movements, so you can essentially flip that relationship around to then give them control over the actual movement,\u201d she said.\n\nIn 2004, a tiny device known as the Utah array was implanted in a human for the first time, allowing a paralyzed man to control a computer cursor with his neural impulses. The device, invented by Richard Normann at the University of Utah, looks like a small chip with thin spikes that are actually dozens of tiny electrodes. The array is designed to attach to the skull through an opening in the skin.\n\nUsing the Utah array, scientists have been able to demonstrate how brain-computer interfaces can help people control a robotic arm with their mind, stimulate their own muscles and limbs, use computers and other external devices, and even decode handwriting and speech.\n\n\u201cAll of that was a really important proof of concept to show that this technology could be useful,\u201d said Collinger, whose own work focuses on restoring arm and hand function to allow patients with paralysis not just to move these appendages, but also to use them to manipulate objects and perform more skillful movements that incorporate tactile signals and other forms of sensory feedback. The idea is to enable a wider range of functions necessary for day-to-day life.\n\nEnter Neuralink. Musk\u2019s startup, along with other similar private ventures such as Synchron and Precision Neuroscience, are essentially taking what has been learned over decades to make brain-computer interfaces more practical for more patients.\n\nNeuralink won approval last year from the Food and Drug Administration to conduct its first human clinical study. Details about who was selected and the procedure to implant the device that Musk said took place Sunday were few and far between, but the company has been developing a brain implant that would allow people, such as patients with severe paralysis, to control a computer, phone or other external device using their thoughts.\n\nThe startup has already made several big leaps forward.\n\nUnlike the Utah array, Neuralink\u2019s device is fully implantable, which means patients could eventually be less constrained \u2014 most implants require people to perform activities in a controlled lab setting.\n\n\u201cThat was a huge engineering challenge,\u201d Gaunt said. \u201cThat was the sort of thing that academics and other people had de-risked over many decades, but it really took a difficult and concerted engineering effort to actually build it.\u201d\n\nThere have been some bumps along the way. The company was mired in controversy after activist groups and internal staff complaints alleged that Neuralink mistreated some of the animals used in experiments. A federal investigation did not turn up evidence of any violations beyond an \u201cadverse surgical event\u201d in 2019 that the company reported itself, according to Reuters.\n\nNeuralink is not the first to put a fully implantable brain-computer interface in a human patient, but Gaunt said the company has improved how much these devices can record by leaps and bounds.\n\nNeuralink also uses innovative robotic surgery, rather than a specialized neurosurgeon, to implant the device.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s way different from what people have done before,\u201d said Sergey Stavisky, an assistant professor in the department of neurological surgery at the University of California, Davis, and co-director of the UC Davis Neuroprosthetics Lab.\n\nStavisky said automating the procedure with a robot could make it more efficient and effective down the road.\n\n\u201cYou can put more of them in, you can put them in quickly, you can avoid blood vessels,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it\u2019s also just hard and new, and you have to show that the robot is safe.\u201d\n\nDemonstrating safety will be one of the primary functions of Neuralink\u2019s clinical trial. In the coming months, the startup will need to show that its device can function with no serious adverse effects.\n\nWhether the implant works as intended also remains to be seen. In his announcement on X, Musk said the patient \u201cis recovering well\u201d and that initial results \u201cshow promising neuron spike detection.\u201d\n\nWithout data, it\u2019s difficult to know what that means, but Gaunt said it likely indicates that the electrodes are in place, a neuron nearby has fired and the implant can essentially detect that activity.\n\n\u201cIt basically means that, at least on some level, it\u2019s working,\u201d he said.\n\nMusk said the early clinical trials will aim to treat people with paralysis or paraplegia. If the device works, it could one day be used to address a range of ailments.\n\nDr. David Brandman, a neurosurgeon who co-directs the UC Davis Neuroprosthetics Lab with Stavisky, already uses fully implanted devices to treat patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease, seizures and abnormal pain.\n\nWhen it comes to medical needs, brain-computer interfaces can make a huge impact, he said, including for stroke survivors and patients with spinal cord injury, paralysis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).\n\nBeyond clinical applications, it\u2019s easy for the imagination to run wild with sci-fi notions of bioengineering. Musk himself has stoked those fantasies, saying in 2022 that he plans to get one of Neuralink\u2019s implants someday.\n\nMany scientists, however, think that kind of thinking is too far off in the distant future \u2014 and not very practical.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s really too soon to be talking about that,\u201d Brandman said. \u201cThere are people in need, and any emphasis on \u2018what if\u2019 and \u2018what could happen\u2019 is doing a disservice to people that need a device.\u201d\n\nAnd while the idea of brain-controlled devices may suggest the potential for augmenting human abilities, scientists agree that so far there has been no demonstration that these implants can improve functions over what a nondisabled person can do.\n\n\u201cThe idea that these devices will allow us to achieve any sort of superhuman ability is just science fiction at this point,\u201d Gaunt said.\n\nStill, Neuralink\u2019s clinical trial represents a big development for the field of neuroscience and bioengineering. And rather than overshadow their own efforts, Gaunt and others said it\u2019s natural for industry to step in and build upon what the academic world has achieved.\n\n\u201cUniversities and academic labs are places that really excel in breaking brand-new ground, going places nobody\u2019s ever gone before and trying things that are way too risky for companies and investors to put their money into,\u201d Gaunt said.\n\nOnce brain implants demonstrated real capabilities, for instance, private companies started stepping in with resources and capital that dwarf what\u2019s available through research grants to build a commercially viable product, he added.\n\nIf anything, Gaunt said Neuralink\u2019s early successes are a testament to the importance of funding basic scientific research.\n\nWhere all the industry developments leave those in academia, though, could be tougher to predict.\n\nStavisky said it\u2019s up to the scientific community to figure out the next frontier in the field, likening the process to surfing ahead of the wave and pushing science forward in a way that may again translate to commercial developments in the future.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t necessarily mean all the flashy headlines and attention on Musk and Neuralink don\u2019t have an effect, Gaunt said.\n\n\u201cEvery once in a while when these sorts of things happen, I do wake up with an existential crisis,\u201d he said, \u201cbut then reality sets in, and I think about how there will always be challenges and basic science that needs to be solved.\u201d",
